# ‚è≥ Timeboxes (until XX:25)


### [Numeric conversion rules wording is inconsistent ¬∑ Issue #4538](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4538)



* KG: f32‚Äôs specification is different from the other ones. Is this on purpose?
* DN: This is kind of the same as the next issue. The difference is floating-point to integer-conversions versus integer-to-integer conversions. We introduced a distinction between these two because we wanted to introduce clamping on the floating-point side.
* KG: let‚Äôs discuss the next two points.
* In light of #4569 being closed:
* DN: Let‚Äôs think about this one a bit more.


### [u32(abstractint) errors on out of bounds value, u32(abstractfloat) and u32(f32) clamps out of bounds value ¬∑ Issue #4569 ¬∑ gpuweb/gpuweb ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4569)



* KG:  There‚Äôs a collision between the desire to lossily-cast something at run time and the desire to strictly cast things at compile time when we have abstract types.
* KG: Mozilla is probably most in favor of saying, this is weird, but we have conflicting desires that can‚Äôt be squared in a way that yields perfectly consistent behavior. So, we‚Äôd recommend no change. And this is in an edge case - we are probably not going to get memed for ridiculous behavior over this.
* KG: The u32 built-in operator is a five-piece case analysis, which shows how many roles it‚Äôs trying to play, as it guesses what you want. Indicates presence of a hazard.
* KG: Mozilla‚Äôs feeling: no change is best
* AB: We‚Äôd be okay with no change. Suggested introducing a diagnostic, might be useful. The fact that we have both value-preserving and bitcast-style conversion operations makes it okay for these to be different.
* KG: We do have bitcast. The code is asking for a bitcast when there is a more explicit way to get that.
* KG: If folks want more time to consider this, that‚Äôs fine, but we did arrive at this behavior for a reason. Close for now?
* **RESOLUTION: CLOSE**


### [[Feature Request] Allow readonly usage of atomics ¬∑ Issue #4574](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4574)



* KG: A struct has an atomic in it. We can put that in read-write storage, but you‚Äôre not allowed to put it in read-only storage, because our rules don‚Äôt permit it.
* AB: This came out of a discussion where the author wanted to re-use structures, but wanted to remove the atomicness in one case, wanted to reuse the atomics in read-only storage.
* AB: This would take some work in our backends, so we would like this not to be a priority.
* JB: That‚Äôs Mozilla‚Äôs opinion too.  Do it later if we want it later.


### [Should @diagnostic be allowed in the middle of lines? ¬∑ Issue #4595](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4595)



* [issue was closed]


### [smoothstep: is it an error when `low == high` and/or `low > high` (when constant/pipline-evaluated) ¬∑ Issue #4561](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4561) 



* KG: In underlying APIs this is UB. We promise portable runtime behavior, the question here is how constant evaluation should proceed: polyfill, or report an error, or a warning
* AB: evaluation errors would be consistent with other builtins. This seems like a spec bugfix.
* DN: GLSL goes out of its way to say you shouldn‚Äôt do this
* **RESOLVED: MODULE-CREATION-TIME ERROR**

# ‚öñÔ∏è Discussions


### [Compat: WGSL validation at createShaderModule or createPipleine time? ¬∑ Issue #4568](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4568)



* (DS: Generally errors are generated as soon as possible. But currently Dawn is validating compat rules only at pipeline creation time. But these oppose each other.  If all the compat info is available at shader-creation time, then should those be shader-creation errors.)
* (MW: Lean checking more things at shader-creation time, but will take a look.)
* JB: Mozilla tended to want to make it a module-creation -time error. It‚Äôs more consistent, and easier to plumb the diagnostics through (if you want good diagnostics). It‚Äôs an advantage to have alternate code paths for the two cases and select compat vs. non-compat at pipeline-creation time. But that‚Äôs a lean.
* KN: I‚Äôm in favour of them being consistent, but I‚Äôm concerned we‚Äôll want to solve the problem in general, so it will be easier to pick up optional features. 
* KG: If we want to delay the error to pipeline time, we can add that to the shading language spec. There‚Äôs some backward compat risk if we later move these validations to pipeline creation time.
* KN: If we want to move errors to pipeline creation time, then all syntax for all the features need to be parseable by all browsers. So you can read entry points but ignore as needed.
* JB: We‚Äôre in an unusual situation; we‚Äôre starting it with a complete thing but export it to implement a subset. So having to parse everything is not a problem; the implementation already does.
* KN: Right, it‚Äôs an issue for future optional features. But it would be nice to be consistent.
* DS: If we add int64, then you have to parse some new suffix for int64 literals. How do you handle that.
* KN: Generalize the grammar, e.g. allowing any letter suffix to numbers.
* JB: The more we talk about applying this to other features the more uncomfortable I become with delaying errors to pipeline creation. The more we talk about this as a general solution I want to make it error at shader-creation time.
* MW: I have similar concerns.
* KN: We can revisit this later. As far as implementation, try to make it easier to change in the future.
* KG: Sound like consensus that the cautious path is to make it an error at shader creation time. We can revisit as needed.
