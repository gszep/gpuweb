There are many ways to reach out to the people developing WebGPU and the WebGPU community in general. So if you have questions, feedback or other, don't be shy and reach out! Some of the places where you can discuss WebGPU are:

 - [WebGPU issue tracker](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues) for feedback, bug reports or features request on the WebGPU or WGSL specifications. Note that browser issues should instead be filed in the respective browser issue tracker.
 - [WebGPU Github discussions](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/discussions) for general discussion around the specification.
 - The [public-gpu](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-gpu/) W3C mailing list. You can subscribe to it from the [W3C group page](https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/).
 - [WebGPU Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#WebGPU:matrix.org) that is a chatroom with many community members. Other Web-graphics related rooms are aggregated in the [Web-graphics Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#webgraphics:matrix.org).
