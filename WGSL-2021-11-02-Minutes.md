# ‚è≥ Timeboxes


### [Allow f suffix for float literals #2210](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2210)



* AB: This is included in the ‚Äúliteral unification‚Äù PR #2227.


### [Consider replacing elseif with else if #2212](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2212)



* RM: PR if we go that way: [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2239](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2239)
* AB: It‚Äôs in conflict with removing braces (which was proposed elsewhere).  Ok with this if we don‚Äôt remove the requirement for braces.
* GR: Does requiring braces make this harder?
* RM: It makes it easier to require, rather than if it were optional.
* MM: Do we have to pick just one of ‚Äúrequired braces‚Äù or ‚Äúelse if‚Äù?
* JG: Yes, we pick one of the two. If you make both changes, you have the dangling else problem.
* KN: another solution is to only allow removing braces for some specific statements, not including if statements


### [Clarify the rule about discard in a continuing block #2219](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2219)



* DN: I think we got consensus offline.
* MM: If we do modules, does this need an extra annotation?
* RM: We need to know this for behavioral analysis anyway
* DN: And `discard` only valid in frag shaders, so we definitely need to know this anyway
* AB: Is RM fixing his PR?
* RM: I was waiting for decision, but I can either have this in the main PR or make a new PR just for this
* **RM to resolve this**


### [Feedback after porting ~80 shaders from GLSL to WGSL #2204](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/discussions/2204)



* MM: Really helpful list, thank you to the authors. Didn‚Äôt see anything that was super urgent, but together this is like a death by a thousand papercuts, so our feeling is that we want to fix *some* of these for v1. (presumably the easier ones)
* GR: Something that surprised me was the order of params in the `select` command. FWIW HLSL just got a `select` that is different: select(cond, true_val, false_val)
* ‚Ä¶
* DN: MSL has (false, true, cond)
* JG: I would imagine that one reason to want cond last is because we want the instinct to be that authors expect true and false expressions to be both evaluated before choosing which one via cond.
* MM: In order for any of these issues to be fixed, we need filed Issues for them, so we should file Issues for them.
* GR: The `select` issue might actually only be from the blog post. There are slight differences between this Issue and the blog post
* 
* RM: Would rather have ‚Äòif else‚Äô as an expression.  Since they have braces, it would not have ambiguity.
* **GR to file `select` issue DONE: [Select operator arguments are in a non-intuitive order ¬∑ Issue #2242 ¬∑ gpuweb/gpuweb (github.com)](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2242)**
* **JG to file others**


### [support dot(vecN&lt;i32>, vecN&lt;i32>) in WGSL #2231 ](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2231) 



* SY: We have use for this in big-int operations.
* AB: Are you expecting hardware accel, or is emulated ok.
* SY: We hope for hardware, but we‚Äôre ok with emulated.  Doing the operation in floating point can lose precision.
* MM: This sounds fine. To us, the barrier to adding functions to the standard library is very low. The main requirement is that if there is hardware support, we need to be sure that we can match the behavior versus the polyfill.
* AB: Spir-v doesn‚Äôt really have wide support, and where there is support it‚Äôs mostly for smaller ints. So long as we‚Äôre fine without hwaccel, I think it‚Äôs easy enough to add for convenience. 
* **Resolved yes: Needs spec (Intel to write PR)**


### [Behaviours analysis #2216](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2216)



* AB: Looking good. Happy with where this is going. 
* RM: Thanks, any outstanding issues?
* AB: Just take out the discard, and DN‚Äôs issues.
* RM: I applied those, so I‚Äôll just do the discard part, thanks.
* DN: I think we can land this and if I find an issue I‚Äôll file an issue.
* **Resolved fix up and give DN a day, and then land**


### [Add a memory model mapping to Vulkan #2055](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2055)



* AB: I appreciate RM‚Äôs review. Some things I want to address, some things to follow on, RM filed an issue, but I think no course-correction is needed.
* RM: Yes, just editorial fixes, and one non-blocking issue.
* **Resolved: land when ready**


### [Should WGSL expose the concept of coherent buffers? ¬∑ Issue #1621](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1621)



* Related to #2055


---


# ‚öñÔ∏è Discussions


### [The order of top-level declarations should be irrelevant #875](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/875)



* DN: We looked offline, some recommendations:
    * 1. Move enable directives to always-at-top
    * 2. When you make a decl, where is it visible? Top-level-decl visible across entire module.
    * Must watch out for ‚Äúsilly cycles‚Äù, like declarations that depend on how they‚Äôre defined
* RM: Happy with this, and we already have checks like this for recursion, so we don‚Äôt see this as an issue.
* JB: Naga also already handles the acyclic check separately from the parser
* **Resolved as above, Needs Spec**


### [MSL does not support address-of vector component #1931](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1931) 



* See also [PR #2225: Disallow taking the address of a vector component](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2225)
* DN: There‚Äôs a PR based on what we decided. It‚Äôs not type-based, but it does the thing we need. I think we can land.
* MM: +1
* **Resolved: Merge**


### [Literal unification, bottom-up #2227](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2227)



* AB: Wanted to raise: doing calculations in an idealized-number space.  We assume we‚Äôll get to doing constexpr, should constexpr also operate in an ideal space.
* RM: Have comments about the PR, in particular the concept of calculation in the ideal space. It can‚Äôt necessarily be done in the shader itself. E.g. 64 bit values (integer and double precision). Makes it impossible to do some kind of refactoring; or rather it can silently get the answer wrong when you refactor.
    * let y = (... + ...) - ...;
    * Vs.
    * let x = ... + ...;
    * let y = x + ...;
    * These would have different answers because .e.g the first is arithmetic over doubles for literals.  The second collapses x into f32 first.  So you get precision differences.
* RM: To handle 1 + 1 + 1u, have a simpler different way based on Myles‚Äô older proposal.  Need to write it down.
* AB: The PR I first wrote on this didn‚Äôt do it in an ideal space. It‚Äôs easy enough to phrase it either way.   From an internal discussion, we should keep in mind that constexpr has similar considerations and may want to do 
* JG: Doesn‚Äôt golang have something like float256 types for literals?
* DN: Yeah, though that‚Äôs the minimum. Feedback is really positive because people can just ignore bit sizes as ‚Äúlarge enough‚Äù. Our proposal we stuck to 64-bit to sort of split the difference without requiring anything more complicated in the implementation.
* MM: If you have a bunch of literals added together, the default type of the literals are f32, but the ops prefer f64 somehow, because it‚Äôs actually dealing with different rules for literals. (Even if the dev hasn‚Äôt enabled any f64 extension)
* RM: I was expecting a different solution here.  Expecting a solution where you can get exactly the same answer by adding suffixes.
* AB: One example that was annoying was minimum integer: Can‚Äôt write the minimum int as a literal, which is hard to solve.
* RM: Agreed that unary minus is an allowable exception, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me quite as much for some reason. It doesn‚Äôt change the precision of fp.  Can have unary negation as applying to ‚Äúideal space‚Äù but not other operations.
* MM: We‚Äôre asking for ~a week to write up a counter-proposal, and then we can come back and discuss them side-by-side.
* **Resolved: Wait on counter-proposal.**


### [Parallels between WGSL and SPIR-V don't justify `let` ¬∑ Issue #2207](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2207)



* JB: So I think the consensus is that we should do nothing.
* MM: +1
* GR: but was a pain point for the guy who ported lots of shaders
* JB: The title needs to be read very literally: There may be justifications for `let`, but parallels between WGSL and SPIR-V don‚Äôt.
* **Resolved: ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, Closed**
