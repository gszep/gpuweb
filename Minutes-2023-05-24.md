## Tentative agenda



* Administrivia
    * Fingerprinting Surface [#3101](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/3101)
        * This conversation seems stalled. To help move forward we should organize to attend a PING meeting with interested WebGPU folks (meetings are 9 AM PT Thursdays). Collect a list of interested folks, find a date to discuss with the PING.
* CTS Update
* “Tacit Resolution” [Queue](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues?q=label%3A%22tacit+resolution+queue%22)
* Handling of omitted labels is unclear [#4083](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4083)
* More promise ordering guarantees [#4117](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/4117)
* Timestamp query resets [#4069](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4069)
* Copying depth32float to depth32float [#4125](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4125)
* Agenda for next meeting

## Administrivia



* Fingerprinting Surface [#3101](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/3101)

## CTS Update



* Google team working on:
    * AbstractFloat behavior/precision testing
    * Texture filtering testing
    * Fixed an issue with WPT build
    * etc.
* KG: Mozilla getting test expectations stood up
    * KG: 
    * KN: Happy to talk about chunking less finely
    * KG: Think it’s 
    * KG: Find CTS and TypeScript hard to develop with
    * MM: Agree about TypeScript
    * MM: Finding opposite problem - chunked too coarsely
    * KG: CI import sees every single subtest
    * MM: Sounds like we’re picking opposite extremes
    * …
    * MM: Want bundles of tests that take a few seconds to run. Likely to want to run an offline script with infinite timeouts that measures how long each subtest takes. Then an offline tool can build bundles of tests which will add to a particular time target
    * KN: Happy to help get default bundles into the CTS


## “Tacit Resolution” [Queue](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues?q=label%3A%22tacit+resolution+queue%22)



* None (editors have been meeting less frequently)


## Handling of omitted labels is unclear [#4083](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4083)



* JB: Defaulting to empty string seems like a perfectly good solution
* (Agreement)
* Resolved


## More promise ordering guarantees [#4117](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/4117)



* JB: (confirmation of the motivation for these guarantees)
* (Agreement)
* Resolved: accept


## Timestamp query resets [#4069](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4069)



* MM: Possible for rollover to happen but to still not see timestamp move backward.
* all: Think we can’t/shouldn’t do try to paper over anything here.
* BJ: Text currently in the spec …
* KN: … needs work.
* MM: To be developer friendly basically warn developers about this happening and how it can happen
* KG: We want to warn devs not to panic or e.g. throw when timestamps appear to go backwards.
* Resolved: do that


## Copying depth32float to depth32float [#4125](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4125)



* &lt;general agreement that copying depth32float to depth32float should work>
* &lt;general un-sure-ness about copying depth32float to anything else>
* Resolved: Allow depth32float-depth32float. Don’t bother to investigate depth&lt;->depth-stencil, and keep disallowing it for now (until someone asks for it later on)


## Agenda for next meeting



* Won’t meet next week due to low agenda
* Please add any items (not just post-v1) to the agenda below!
