### [[wgsl]: textureDimensions() returns vec3 for cube textures ¬∑ Issue #1345 ¬∑ gpuweb/gpuweb](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1345)



*   BC: Not strong feeling, but vec2 might be the worst of the possibilities, since w=h and 6 layers. It seems sort of optimistic to have separate width and height. I think we should either have it take a face id, or instead just return a scalar. However, that‚Äôs not what other APIs do.
*   JG: Why vec2 is a little bit nice. It‚Äôs forward compatible a little bit, at least more than a scalar.  If you swizzle out of vec2, the swizzle works.  But scaling up out of a scalar is not so compatible. Changing size of the vector would be breaking change (necessitating something different)
*   BC: Would be nice to take a face ID param to get select which face you‚Äôre getting the dimensions for.
*   BC: .. more ideas ‚Ä¶  in the realm of very hypothetical here.
*   KN: If we had weirdo squashed cubes it would be a new type, not ‚Äúcube‚Äù.
*   JG: I expected it to return width x width x 6.  But it‚Äôs actually width x width x width. Which is not obvious.
*   KN: Native apis return vec2 width x width. Should just follow.  ‚Ä¶ Hm. It‚Äôs not obvious. Cube_arrays
*   BC: we have separate call to return the array size. 
*   _Resolved: vec2, width x width_


### [wgsl: Fix typo in vertex_index #1687](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1687)



*   _Merged_


### [var: infer type from initializer #1550](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1550)



*   DN: Can live with everywhere but module scope (as DM wants)
*   RM: Can live with that.  Don‚Äôt know why module scope is special.
*   DM: Rust has inference only for local scope.
*   JB: Languages that do inference at module scope:  users suffer
*   _Consensus to go with DM‚Äôs proposal._


### [Limit pipeline constant IDs to between 0 and 65535 #1720](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1720)



*   RM: Can agree since it‚Äôs a limitation of an implementation.
*   JG: Can always do remapping, then IDs don‚Äôt matter.  But not enough functionality to be important enough to add that completely_._
*   _Consensus to merge._


### [Clarify out of bounds behavior #1722](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1722)



*   (out of bounds for non-memory values)
*   AB: If you have plain value for a vector, and extract OOB element, what is the result?  SPIR-V says ‚Äúundef value‚Äù. But we can do better by throwing in a clamp on the index (for example). E.g. ‚Äúget one of the in-range values‚Äù.
*   DM: Robust buffer access behaviour is very close to undefined value anyway.  If we have this for other pieces for memory access, why introduce a stronger claim here only.
    *   Can return anything in the bound memory range, or 0-value
*   JG: Don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs exactly the bound memory range. Not super confident that RBA will cover case of loading vec3 but reading the 4th element. Get garbage from the register.
*   AB: To me it‚Äôs consistent to say it‚Äôs a limited set of values from portability perspective.  Saying ‚Äúundef value‚Äù can work.
*   DM: Saying it‚Äôs limited set of result values is misleading.  ‚ÄúAnywhere in this bound memory range‚Äù is just as bad as ‚Äúundef value‚Äù in practice.
*   AB: An ‚Äúundef value‚Äù may not be something in memory.  It‚Äôs worse.
*   DM: If we do handle that, it‚Äôs extra overhead. And in-memory has different results than on-stack (in-register).  How do you justify this overhead?
*   AB: Don‚Äôt think you dynamic accesses to values. Think it‚Äôs one max.
*   AB: Not concerned about performance if the shader is doing a bad thing.
*   DN: Could promise less now, and promise more later.
*   DM: But you always pay for this.
*   **_Consensus seems to be: when getting data out, it‚Äôs an ‚Äúundef value‚Äù._**
*   **Challenge is to spec that well.**
*   JB: Undef value, undefined behaviour, and unspecified value.
*   RM: For int and float it‚Äôs clear (and include NaN).  For bool, result is either true or false.
*   AB: We don‚Äôt specify a bit pattern for bool.  Can always
*   RC: Want to clarify ‚Äúsafe‚Äù value.  Content from all browser tabs are in the same render process. One tab should not be able to access state outside the security domain of the given.
*   AB: For memory values, want to bound it to bound memory. Discussion is for non-memory composite values (e.g. let v : vec3&lt;i32> = ..)
*   RC: WebGL allows you to return 0 or some other value in the buffer. Can‚Äôt return value from a different tab‚Äôs storage.
*   AB: Implementation has to avoid abutting storage from different domains too closely (e.g. sharing pages or cache lines). But that‚Äôs an implementation detail.
*   RC: For D3D, arrays on stack, there are no guarantees, and would have to clamp those.
*   TR: The guarantee is they won‚Äôt see memory from another process.That‚Äôs not good enough for WebGPU.
*   AB: So please review the memory part of the PR in question. There‚Äôs a bunch of cases you‚Äôve raised that I think are covered in this PR by the pointer and reference parts. Please double check that.
*   TR: Seems some bounds checking code is needed no matter what.  Especially for arrays in local memory.
*   AB: Yes.  And current debate is dynamic index on a let-declared vec3 (for example).  For literal index we can do compile error.
*   TR: Why not define result as 0.
*   AB: Need to be the union across APIs.  ‚ÄúSomewhere in the buffer‚Äù is good for Vulkan. 
*   JG: Metal doesn‚Äôt give guarantees at all.
*   TR: Wonder what the difference in performance is between predicating the store vs. allowing the store to go ahead with an out-of-bounds access being wrapped.
*   JG: Don‚Äôt care about perf of a bad program.
*   TR: I‚Äôve seen code patterns that purposely do OOB to get the 0.
*   _Action on Microsoft to review the memory parts._
*   _Action on AB to update the ‚Äúundef value‚Äù part_


### [wgsl: describe derivatives, related uniformity #1728](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1728)



*   Non controversial
*   Consensus; let‚Äôs merge it.

## Discuss


### [Buffer indices should be unsigned ¬∑ Issue #1135 ¬∑ gpuweb/gpuweb](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1135) 



*   JG: Think we‚Äôre headed: unsigned
*   DM: Think we‚Äôre headed: signed
*   DN: Want array elem count bounded above by signed max
*   RM: Thought we were going to allow both
*   AB: ‚Ä¶ provided array elem count is limited to signed max.
*   ‚Ä¶ discussion about how to do the signed max check:   u32(i) &lt;= u32(INT_MAX).  Is one operation because the bitcast is free.
*   AB: Taking unsigned only: usability with integer literal.
*   JG: Larger question about what is the type of the literal.
*   AB: Those other languages have more implicit conversions than WGSL does.
*   JG: The main usability concern is do-what-i-mean with literals. It‚Äôs stronger than the guardrails provided by lack of automatic-convertibility.
*   TR: HLSL has a special literal type for float or int literals. Nice, but carry their own problems; have corner cases that don‚Äôt have perfect solutions. E.g. ternary operator.
*   JG: Folks like unsigned for indices because it‚Äôs an implied immediate constraint. If we accept only signed for the array indices, then we force people to cast. We should not do that.  I‚Äôm inclined to accepting signed or unsigned here. Slight preference to accept unsigned only if we pick only one.
*   DN: Let‚Äôs work out a written proposal for ‚Äúwhat if you allow signed and unsigned, limit array size to INT_MAX, and plan what happens down the road when very large arrays are allowed. What do you do with u32(3billion).‚Äù
