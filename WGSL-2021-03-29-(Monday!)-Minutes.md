### [Support for vector splats (scalar operations on vectors) #1520](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1520)



*   E.g. `vec(x,y) * 2.0`
*   Previously:
*   JG: I‚Äôll survey other shader languages to see what they have.
*   GR: I volunteer to get the answer for HLSL.
*   GR (later): HLSL accepts every arithmetic operation between vectors and scalars and matrices and ~~vectors~~ scalars for both DXC and FXC
*   GR: HLSL supports bitwise ops too in all scalar with sequential types
*   GR: and also the transposition of any and all operands
*   MM: Metal supports vector {*,/,+,-} scalar
*   MM: Metal supports scalar {*,/,+,-} vector
*   MM: Metal supports matrix {*,/} scalar
*   MM: Metal supports scalar * matrix
*   MM: Metal supports matrix * vector
*   MM: Metal supports vector * matrix
*   DN: on the issue, Mohammed found what GLSL supports.  [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1520#issuecomment-806004434](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1520#issuecomment-806004434) Pretty liberal mixing of scalar-vector and scalar-matrix, and  +,-,/ for matrix-matrix of same dimensions.
*   AB: GLSL also supports some bit-operations over these.
*   JG: I mainly care about arithmetic operations.
*   MM: Propose WGSL support the intersection of GLSL,HLSL,MSL
*   DM: When do we stop. What about shifts?
*   MM: Think the result falls out. See GLSL restrictions.
*   AB: GLSL supports i
*   DN: Small concern: Does this block us from having e.g. `1` being contextually 1i or 1.0f?
*   AB: GLSL does the conversion before splatting
*   MM: I think we have solutions here
*   GR: Do we want to include mat*scalar here?
*   MM: Probably, more for mult than div.
*   JG: Ok, I will write up proposal based on intersections


### [add syntax for very short const declarations inside a function #1552](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1552)



*   E.g. `x := expr;` ~= `const x = expr;`
*   AB: Why not just use ‚Äò=‚Äô
*   MM: Think that causes more bugs than it helps.
*   _Probably not ‚Äò=‚Äô_
*   JG: ‚Äòconst‚Äô is longer than ‚Äòlet‚Äô.  ‚ÄòConst‚Äô is 5 letters, ‚Äòlet‚Äô is 3.  Don‚Äôt mind typing ‚Äòlet‚Äô a lot, but ‚Äòconst‚Äô is annoying.  But JS ‚Äòlet‚Äô is mutable.
*   KN: := is arcane looking.  Looks incongruous with the rest of the syntax.  Symbols are harder to google.
*   AB: if you allow := here, would want := usable in the long const form.
*   GR: ‚Äúlet‚Äù is not that easy to search.
*   JB: Rust ‚Äúlet‚Äù or ‚ÄúJS let‚Äù yields meaningful results.
*   Brandon: Be nice to use let as long as syntactic divergence is not too bad.
*   MM: but then `let` being immutable is a difference from JS.
*   JG: That may be a tolerable difference.
*   MM: ‚Äòlet‚Äô or ‚Äòdef‚Äô would replace ‚Äòconst‚Äô.
*   KN: Our const is a lot more const-ier than JS.
*   MM: Webkit team ok with either const or let
*   DM: Main problem was writing the type all the time, can accept const or let.
*   


### [Describe location requirements #1519](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1519)



*   (Limit structures to 1-level deep only.)
*   MM: Question. Entry points have many arguments.  Is only one argument allowed to have these locations.
*   AB: They are allowed across many.
*   MM: Are builtins allowed among ordinary location-decorated?
*   AB: That‚Äôs allowed.
*   MM: That‚Äôs fine.
*   DM: Reason it‚Äôs on the agenda is restriction to 1-level depth.
*   MM: Allowing intermixing means it‚Äôs reasonable.  Otherwise may have had a different design.
*   _Resolved as approved._
*   _Merged._


### [Remove the void type #1460](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1460)



*   Deferred to tomorrow.


### [Add /* */ block comments. #1470](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1470)



*   JG: Motivation is commenting out large blocks of code.
*   MM: Also support block comments.
*   JB: I use an editor that helps and I still use block comments.
*   GR: Pain to parse, but l‚Äôm ambivalent.
*   DN: In the past I‚Äôve seen incompatibilities.  Must have good testing for this to ensure consistency.
*   MM: What about nesting.
*   DN: Please no.
*   JB: Real purpose is commenting out code. Glad we don‚Äôt have a preprocessor; if we had preprocessor we‚Äôd use #if 0, which nests. So nesting is valuable.
*   MM: Value of block comments is to comment out code in O(1) effort.  But there are al
*   (nesting is complicated)
*   MM: Should we just try writing down the state machine for line-and-block comment nesting? I can do this
*

## Discuss


### [Restrict where entry point IO types can be used #1526](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1526)



*   JP: We looked at a bunch of cases, concluded the best spot is to not restrict; ignore the locationIO/builtin when not used in that context.
*   MM: Sounds good.
*   DM: Feel like we should forbid structs from being host-sharable and for input/output
*   AB: Argument against that is we have default layouts to apply to host-shared.
*   BC: Rule is simple: interpret the annotation only when used in a meaningful context. 
*   MM: Consider comparing a type between a uniform and an input. In order to assign them, they need to be actually the same type.
*   DM: Ok that‚Äôs compelling
*   AB: Can‚Äôt actually do == on struct.
*   MM: Sure‚Ä¶ will propose.
*   KN: can‚Äôt do == on struct in C++, unless you overload the equality operator.
*   MM: Ah, you‚Äôre right.
*   GR: Confirm HLSL can‚Äôt do == on structs.
*   [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1572](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1572) re equality on structs


### [Remove the requirement to have entry points #1340](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1340) 



*   DN: For the cases that you might not have an entry point, can always insert a dummy you‚Äôll never call.
*   MM: Can lead to cargo-culting, where it‚Äôs always added even when not needed.  which would be unfortunate.
*   DN: Didn‚Äôt think there would be such strong feelings about it. Thought this was an opportunity to help the user when they forget the ‚Äústage‚Äù attribute.  If createShaderModule is given a module with no entry point, can always save a dummy empty module.  
*   JG: Give a warning if there‚Äôs no stage attribute.
*   _Consensus to remove the requirement._

# üìÜ Next Meeting Agenda



*   Next meeting: 2021-03-30 (like normal)
*   Rename ‚Äúvalue types‚Äù to ‚Äúplain types‚Äù. [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1568](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1568)  
    *   Arguably it‚Äôs purely editorial.
*   ptr/ref:  [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1569](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1569) 
    *   Describes the consensus from [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1456](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1456) 
*   [Remove the void type #1460](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1460)
*   Maybe [Add /* */ block comments. #1470](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1470)
*   Maybe [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1571](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1571)
