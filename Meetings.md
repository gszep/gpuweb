"Office Hours" are offered as open, supplemental, and very optional collaboration sessions to work on details and brainstorming. No decisions are made during office hours except ones that would be otherwise resolved on GitHub issues/PRs. Our "official" discussion and decision session/forum is still the WGSL meeting itself.
