# ‚è≥ Timeboxes (until 11:30)


### [uniformity analysis + basic tail-branching #3007](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/3007) 



* DN: Computers don‚Äôt work the way you think they do. If you believe the world is inlined always, then this simplifies down, but I‚Äôm not sure we can rely on it.
* DN: If you introduce subgroups into this, I‚Äôve demonstrated that you *don‚Äôt* get subgroup reconvergence at end of function. We know it‚Äôs annoying, but it‚Äôs the rule.
* DN: We have spec‚Äôd what we can. 
* MM: When we discussed whether returns reconverge, we said ‚Äúno‚Äù, and said we‚Äôd file an issue. It‚Äôs likely that programmers‚Äô expectations don‚Äôt reflect what we do today. We should try to match programmer expectations, unless that‚Äôs too hard.
* DN: I agree that there‚Äôs a mismatch.
* DS: What do we do now? While we can rewrite e.g. with local variables, I worry that we might cause a performance issue in doing that rewrite.
* Options:
    * 1. We do what we have now. All burden is on users to adapt their shader.
    * 2. Add annotation like @reconverge to ask the compiler to rewrite it to ensure a single return.
        * 2b.  Inverse:  annotate the ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt restructure this, at risk of triggering uniformity error‚Äù.
    * 3. Compiler detects #2 but does the rewrite automatically. Potentially risk performance pit because you use extra variables and control flow.
* MM: So the rewriting would rewrite return V into storing V into a return function local var, and break back out?
* DS: Yes
* MM: Does any compiler do this?
* DS: Tint no
* KG: Naga no
* TR: DXC has this
* DN: Why?
* TR: It was useful to someone in some cases. It‚Äôs called ‚Äústructurize return‚Äù
* (trying to find it) `dxc -T ps_6_0 -opt-enable structurize-returns`
* Other links:
    * [https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/lib/Transforms/Scalar/StructurizeCFG.cpp](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/lib/Transforms/Scalar/StructurizeCFG.cpp)
    * [https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/blob/master/source/opt/merge_return_pass.h](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/blob/master/source/opt/merge_return_pass.h)
    * [https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/tools/clang/test/HLSLFileCheck/hlsl/control_flow/loops/structurize_multiexit_crash_do.hlsl](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/tools/clang/test/HLSLFileCheck/hlsl/control_flow/loops/structurize_multiexit_crash_do.hlsl)
* KG: Do we need this in v1? People have a workaround.
* MM: I think programmers will get caught by this a lot, so we should probably do this in v1.
* DN: I want another week, I want AB to weigh in.
* MM: Is this a whole-program problem?
* DN: Yes.
* TR: So you‚Äôre saying the control flow uniformity is leaking? So e.g. the instruction pointer might desync.
* int foo() { if (tid % 2 == 0) { return 4; } else { return 5; } int bar() { foo(); barrier(); }
    * The barrier() is legal in HLSL
* TR: HLSL does reconvergence; as if predicated execution across the entire wave.
* DS: So it‚Äôs just SPIR-V that doesn‚Äôt reconverge coming out of functions?
* DN: Yes
* DN: So on the table is that we give the programmer this tool, and UAs will polyfill this as needed.
* ??: We also need to decide implicit or explicit
* **Come back next week**

# ‚öñÔ∏è Discussions


### [WGSL pointer aliasing rules ¬∑ Issue #1457](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1457)



* MM: Talked internally. Our general position is unchanged. We do understand that in HLSL, for in-out params, it‚Äôs not generally possible to support aliasing, to behave as-if params are aliased, is to specialize each (aliasable) param. That means 2^N specializations, which would not be good.
* MM: What I‚Äôm sort of asking for what our philosophy is. 
* DN: So this is exactly and only about function params?
* MM: Is it? You can have a function that [...]
* MM: The problem is larger than just function params.
* [...]
* DS: I filed an issue about local aliases
* [...]
* MM: If the problem can be decomposed into function parameters which may or may not alias, as distinct from aliasing that occurs within the body of the function. I think there‚Äôs a path forward. I think the second one can be legal, but that we can‚Äôt support the first one.
* DN: Agreed.
* [,,,]
* MM: Does HLSL have mutable global variables?
* TR: Yes, `static`
* TR: so what about this example? [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1457#issuecomment-788202781](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1457#issuecomment-788202781) 
* DN: I would need to look at the table in the SPIR-V spec.
* MM: It  would be better than saying ‚Äúthis is bad, don‚Äôt do it‚Äù, it would be better if we had defined behavior here; in the worst case it would be what HLSL does, which may be:  Either there is no aliasing, or at worst copy-in copy-out for those inout params.
* DN: I want to think about if weirder things can happen. **I want to take this offline to think about this.  Can you get more confusing results than HLSL‚Äôs worst case.**
* MM: Can we agree on generalities, even if not specifics?
* KG: I don‚Äôt understand this well enough to talk in generalities.
* MM: What can we do next?
* DN: We can clarify our language for ‚Äúroot identifiers‚Äù
* DS: ‚ÄúIf you have a module-scoped thing, can you alias that?‚Äù
* MM: I propose ‚Äútry as hard as we can, but don‚Äôt promise consistent behavior‚Äù
* MM: Aside: Internally we call ‚Äúprogrammer-expected behavior‚Äù ‚Äújavascript behavior‚Äù, and JS has well-defined aliasing.
* [...]
* DN: I don‚Äôt want to tie us to inlining, especially because of potential combinatorial explosions
* 


### [Investigation: kill vs demoteToHelper behavior in native APIs ¬∑ Issue #921](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/921)



* DN: We now think we should just use Demote. If we had both, people will end up just using Demote.
* DN: We do need to figure out what termination guarantees are, or at least a way to explain when we don‚Äôt have them.
* MM: It would be cool to pick a good name, even if we add terminate later on.
* KG: I think we should call it `discard`, because even when people use `discard` in GLSL, they expect Demote behavior (generally) and not Terminate.
* MM: I would like it if someone else can corroborate ‚Äúwhat glsl authors expect‚Äù
* DN: With demote, I think we can remove Discard state from uniformity analysis.
* KG: I was talking with JB about this, and we think the subset of devices that might actually need a demote‚Äìon-terminate polyfill is narrow. Someone also said that on drivers that pre-date the OpDemoteToHelper extension, often OpDiscard gives OpDemoteToHelper behavior, even though the (current) behavior of OpDiscard is OpTerminate. (i.e it does not continue to contribute to derivative calculation)
* KG: Further, since newer drivers do support OpDemoteToHelper (and old ones might support it accidentally via old-OpDiscard) that we could probably ship v1 without doing the demote‚Äìon-terminate polyfill, and simply not run webgpu on those drivers that need it yet. We could add a demote‚Äìon-terminate polyfill in a later roll-out of support for these drivers.
* **Resolved: `discard` means demote-to-helper**
