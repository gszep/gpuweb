## CTS Update



* Gregg continuing texture builtin tests, finding more weird issues
    * textureGather with integer-format cubemaps seems to be broken on all AMD GPUs
    * Should we restrict the API or leave this as a driver bug?
    * mipmap selection [#4818](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4818)
* Experimental subgroup tests
* Some test flakiness in the past month and haven’t yet determined where it’s coming from


## Talk from UCSC on memory isolation in WebGPU



* [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TNyinlj5WutsaYAB2rEBCRdVNRhTAsLG/edit#slide=id.p1)
* Try the fuzzer: [https://gpuharbor.ucsc.edu/webgpu-race-testing/](https://gpuharbor.ucsc.edu/webgpu-race-testing/)
* MM: A natural way to have test cases would be to look at the source code and the assembly code produced by the GPU shader compiler. Are you looking at the underlying assembly?
* RL: Could have access to SAS and others but would be very difficult to do. More looking at C assembly at the moment. Would love to collaborate on the low-level assembly.
* TS: We have evidence that the underlying compilers are not optimizing things out. We have confidence that the fuzzer does real things because without robustness we see problems (in ⅓ of the fuzz shaders on M1).
* RC: Have you had a chance to run it on Windows?
* RL: Kind of the blindspot, but we know that D3D has a much stronger robustness story, but would love 
* CW: long term solution - suggestions? Previous ideas:
    * Store special idea that driver doesn't know, to launder memory access
    * Smart attacker could double-XOR to make things disappear
    * Only solution: std::launder or similar, forget anything you know about this value
    * RL: Faith Ekstrand during Vulkanized thought yes, have a secret instruction that compilers are instructed not to mess with. Need Vulkan, DX, Metal specs for the same thing. Not a bad idea. JS did think about this, have discussion around data races - dependencies on unsafe lower code? Or are the JS rules ensconced in the lower-level assembly code that JS engines generate?
    * CW: their concerns were more around Spectre than data races. JS engines are the end-to-end optimizing compiler; nothing underneath them.
    * RL: good point, can't optimize everything yourself for WebGPU because there are lower-level compilers. Let's keep thinking about enforcing this in lower-level specs.
* GT: some APIs have robust access. Can't (easily) write a test from WebGPU that checks, even if you read out-of-bounds in the buffer, it's allowed that you get data from elsewhere in the same app.
    * RL: also worrying for WebGPU. In Chrome, all WebGPU goes through the same process. Generally, in the same process, the protections are a lot more limited than if everything was in separate processes. How to know it's from your app, another tab's app, etc.?
    * TS: easiest thing might be to highlight values you didn't put into that specific buffer, even if it's a false positive.


## Milestone 0



* Missing dynamic offset validation in "Validate encoder bind groups" [#4811](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4811)
    * **Resolved to fix the bug, Teo to make a PR**
* remove sourceMap from GPUShaderModuleDescriptor [#4808](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4808)
    * CW: suggest we figure this out in M2. Nobody's implementing this yet.
    * MM: sure, as long as applications using this don't break in the bindings layer.
    * (more discussion)
    * **Consensus to remove it for M0**
* mapAsync early-reject doesn't generate a validation error [#4690](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4690)
    * PR now only waiting on Apple review: Generate a validation error on mapAsync early-reject [#4786](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/4786)
    * MW will review.
* **(added late, OK to defer if necessary)** Change mapAsync to also early-reject if already mapped [#4787](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/4787)
    * blocked on the other mapAsync one
    * Makes it so we avoid lots of round-trips to the device timeline
    * For both pending-map and already-mapped, reject immediately on the client side. We have the state on both client and device-timeline sides
    * KG: if we can do it on the client timeline, let's do it on the client timeline
    * MW: OK for WebKit too
    * **Resolved to make this change**
* **(added late, OK to defer if necessary)** maxInterStageShaderComponents seems to overlap with maxInterStageShaderVariables [#4688](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4688)
    * Allow unknown limits to be requested with value undefined [#4781](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/4781)
    * Remove maxInterStageShaderComponents [#4783](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/4783)
    * KG: intent is that implementations should do this
    * KN: like doing non-normative notes for this
    * MW: thumbs up
    * KN: there's also maxInterStageShaderComponents removal. We did agree to do this, but if you want to look at the mechanics, please look at the linked PR.

## [editorial] Consider if there's a much better name for "image copies" [#4573 (comment)](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4573#issuecomment-2183583201)



* CW: technically not a change in the WebGPU API. Not visible anywhere. Kai has a pull request up. Last chance to bikeshed. FYI only.


## (Ken) WebGPU benchmark(s) in MotionMark?



* Focusing on things that browsers can actually control? Like overhead of creating BindGroups, issuing lots of small draw calls (to measure browser overhead), etc.
* Want to avoid turning these tests into benchmarks of the GPU itself.
* Thoughts? More ideas for areas to test?
* KG: MotionMark's goal is to reflect real-world use cases. Trying to not be a microbenchmark.
* MM: Might be confusing with Speedometer that tries to be real world use cases. MotionMark tests individual rendering primitives
* KR: yeah I really dispute that. It's tons of microbenchmarks. Canvas arcs, the Images test which only does CPU readbacks - a pessimal path.
* MM: MM is made of a bunch of benchmarks but the front page runs only a few of them by default. The bar is much higher to get it on the front page.
* CW: Think the intent is that they would graduate to the front page.
* RC: agree with Ken, we should have WebGPU tests in MotionMark. Think they should be reflective of real-world things. But if these become GPU benchmarks I don't think that's necessarily a bad side-effect.
* KR: It is difficult in the 3D space to not end up bottlenecked by something like fill-rate. Should focus on things browsers can optimize, like creating many bindgroups, or many small draws instead of big draws. Gregg tried making benchmarks for WebGL for years and it was very hard.
* MM: The tests in MM also try to benchmark specific things, like we want to optimize lines, so let's do a test for lines. The methodology for MM makes it difficult to put a whole game frame. MM measure the complexity in a time budget, and not how fast a frame renders.
* KR: The WebGL MM draws a bunch of triangles badly.
* KG: Let's be careful of not being fill-rate limited, e.g. keep the resolution very small. We can still do a complexity thing for larger workloads if simple enough "how many frames per frame".
* CW: Seems we have general appetite to add some tests, but should talk with MotionMark people about how to design these
