# ‚è≥ Timeboxes (until XX:15)


## M1:


### [Feature request: textureQueryLod equivalent ¬∑ Issue #4180](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4180)



* Oguz: I made a simple inquiry into the built-in behavior across APIs and drivers. In combination with ecosystem info, I suggest two functions. My comment in the issue: [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4180#issuecomment-1907044827](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4180#issuecomment-1907044827)
* KG: Why two functions?
* MOD: HLSL and MSL have that.
* DN: I don‚Äôt understand the two, the wording is different.  Vulkan‚Äôs reads likes truncated and untruncated.
* MOD: Wrote the app to check.  It‚Äôs really two different values.
* DN: I‚Äôll need time to absorb the example and what it means.
* DN: from SPIR-V spec
    * The first component of the result contains the mipmap array layer.
    * The second component of the result contains the implicit level of detail relative to the base level.
* DN: Seems like it can be affected by sampler LoD offset?
* KG: willing to be a third set of eyes.
* DN: I need more time.
* MOD: Easy to hack the project, linked in the issue.


### [Add PI and TAU builtins ¬∑ Issue #4100](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4100)



* Oguz: Please allow me a week as I‚Äôm almost done with the investigation but had to delay a bit due to recovery, kind regards.
* KG: What‚Äôs the investigation needed?
* MOD: In the past, I had some trouble stemming from the need to specialize to PI_2, etc. in context of equations for integration ops, etc. Thought of validating in those cases and reporting data AoT
* DN: Can write text saying mathematically perfect value; infinitely precise. (maybe rounded up or down maybe)
* KG: We have tacit agreement to add these values. We don‚Äôt have agreement to add pi /2.  We‚Äôd have to reopen it.  Could do that in another issue.
* KG: It‚Äôs about spelling, then write the text.
* MOD: Ok, thank you

# ‚öñÔ∏è Discussions


### [HW Clip Planes support ¬∑ Issue #390](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/390) (M2)



* JS: Investigating the limit of number of clip planes allowed. It seems Metal has an undocumented limit of 8.
* KG: How to bridge the gap between the desire and what can be done.
* JS: We‚Äôre still investigating support level.
* DN: Primer on this feature?
* KG: See the D3D11 functional spec;  describes it well.
* DN: ok.
* KG: There‚Äôs a similar investigation for an extension for WebGL.


### [Shader extensions are redundant ¬∑ Issue #3961](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/3961) (M0)



* DN: Google‚Äôs stance is the redundancy is fine, and do not want a change in the spec.

### [Avoid indeterminate value result for tanh with large input ¬∑ Issue #4458](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4458) (M2)



* ZJ: [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4458](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4458)   tanh is defined over the whole Real number line, but defined as inherited from Sinh and cosh, which overflow very easily.
* AB: Are you proposing hardware returns this, or we would have to polyfill to get this result.
* ZJ: Currently D3D12 is returning NaN for large inputs. Spec currently allows this.  I propose to make the spec strict to prohibit such indeterminate value.
* JS: In ANGLE, extreme values return 1. To work around D3D11 limitations. But it‚Äôs not in the WebGL spec. Want to spec it for WebGPU.
* DN: One way out is to define a second function, `tanhComplete` that is defined over the whole real line. It‚Äôs polyfilled and slow, for the people who need this behavior.
* KG: Seems in the weeds. Resist adding overload for this purpose. What‚Äôs the use case?  My inclination would make it slow but accurate in the common case. Then wait for reports of slowness.
* AB: I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd need a branch, and given the inherent complexity of the core function, it‚Äôs probably fine to throw in selects. Probably used for activations for ML layers.
* JS: (thumbs up about the ML use case)
* AB: Question is where the boundary is, and how to test it. 
* ZJ: Currently the proposed case is based on getting within 0.5ulp for the 1.0 result.  I need to do an on-device investigation.
* AB: As long as we get confident on the transition, it‚Äôs probably fine to put the restriction in.
* KG: I wonder if we should let the implementation choose the threshold. The main issue is to ensure completeness. If that‚Äôs the goal, we have to assert that‚Äôs the case.
* DN: Concern is we would need _some_ rule for the gray area.  In the test suite we would spray values in the region and check.
* KG: Milestone?  
* DN: M2
* DN: I‚Äôm not super-concerned about urgency because a developer can always put the selects in themselves, at the cost of a little extra complexity.

# üìÜ Next Meeting Agenda Requests



* Next meeting?: (**Atlantic-timed**) Tuesday February 13, 2023, **11am-noon** (America/Los_Angeles)
* DN: [#4477](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4477) relax absolute error bound for asin f32: too tight for Intel f32 with DXC
* AB: Next time may want to talk about ecosystem stuff. (maximal reconvergence)
