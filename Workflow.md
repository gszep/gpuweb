This document explains the workflow of developing the API, how it's tracked, and what stages a change needs to go through before it can be considered done.

We use a [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/gpuweb/projects/1) for tracking the status of features and fixes. Every non-trivial change should have a single tracking issue in the [gpuweb](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb) repository, which can link to other issues and PRs. Tracking has to go through the following steps:
  1. _Design_ - The change is on our radar. If work has been started, the tracking issue gets assigned to a "champion", who will drive the discussion. We may be investigating the differences between the native APIs, evaluating the portability and security constraints as well as the value of a change. An [investigation](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/labels/investigation)-labelled issue can be linked with the main one.
  2. _Specification_ - We have accepted one of the proposals and have a rough idea of how the change would be specified and tested. When an issue enters this stage, the assignee is potentially cleared, unless the same person wants to drive it through. Once it's picked up, the assignee works on formally describing the change in the specification. A [gpuweb](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb) project PR may be linked with the main issue.
  6. _Testing_ - We have landed the specification changes, and the assignee gets cleared again. Once it's picked up, the new assignee works on adding tests to support the specified change. A [cts](https://github.com/gpuweb/cts) project PR may be linked with the main issue at this stage.
  7. _Done_ - A change has been either rejected, or fully implemented in the specification and the test suite.

The main tracking issue needs to be manually advanced through tabs as we progress. No "closes Xxx" or "fixes Xxx" is expected to be seen in the PR description, if "Xxx" is a main tracking issue for a change. This may be automated in the future.

In order to get a list of all project issues that are waiting to be picked up, the [following query](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Agpuweb%2F1+no%3Aassignee) can be used. A cursory look at the [project](https://github.com/orgs/gpuweb/projects/1) also can give us a rough idea on what the issues are currently in the works, and which ones need attention.
