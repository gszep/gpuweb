# **‚öñÔ∏è Discussion**


# update IO-shareable to include bool ([#1244](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1244))


# Bools are IO-shareable, but only for builtins ([#1246](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1246))



*   DS: I think we are just waiting on David to update the PR and then it is ready to merge. This blocks frag depth.
*   DM: I think you mean front-facing, which is the boolean flag.
*   DM: Why are we disallowing booleans?
*   DS: I believe Vulkan cannot do that.
*   DM: Kai said that it does not conflict. It is supported for input and output.
*   DS: Only for built-in in/out, not user in/out. See comment in 1244.
*   DS: We could convert the boolean to something else. But why?
*   DM: It‚Äôs just a weird inconsistency.
*   KN: We could promote it to a small integer type without the implementation knowing.
*   DM: Is this supported for host-sharable? We‚Äôre not including uniforms.
*   DM: Let‚Äôs accept this for now. I‚Äôll file a post-MVP issue to relax this.


# [wgsl] Update storage textures to have template params for access type. #1182



*   DM: Please be ready to discuss this next time! We need to make progress.
*   


# Add textureRead() and textureWrite() ([#1261](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1261))



*   DM: Last point of contention is int vs uint. Related to different issue we have filed by CW.
*   DS: That‚Äôs they way does the spec say i32 vs u32. 
*   DS: Spec currently says i32 everywhere due to parsing. If you made it a u32 you‚Äôd have to suffix everything with ‚Äúu‚Äù. So we parse it as an int, and then validate that it is positive.
*   DM: Didn‚Äôt we agree to have mipmap levels as a u32?
*   DS: Not sure. But same thing - it is a u32 for validation, but an i32 for parsing.
*   DM: I think the PR now should be using i32, until we have proper support for u32.
*   DS: Yes, and that change should be done everywhere that it is applicable.
*   Resolution: Accept once the PR has removed the bits changing i32 to u32s (spec text says that the value is limited)


# Consider whether to allow trailing commas ([#1243](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1243))



*   DJ: Sounds like everyone wants it. Is anyone against? No, resolved, accepted.
*   
*   
*   


# WGSL is missing a `sample_mask` builtin. ([#1259](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1259))



*   DS: Biggest question is that this is both input and output, so what do we do?
*   DM: Could come up with different names to avoid confusion and avoid the special case of a builtin that is used in both cases.
*   DS: You‚Äôre suggesting we could have providedSampleMask and returnedSampleMask?
*   DM: I suggest investigating the uses of the input sample mask to see what we should name it.
*   DS: Agreed. I like that it is split into two variables. So, we update the PR to say we need an investigation, with the idea being we‚Äôll probably end up with 2 sample mask builtins. One for input, one for output. Names TBD.
*   


# texture builtins: For most texture builtins, Vulkan only allows compile-time-constant offset, and with with bounded range ([#1235](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1235))



*   Discussed yesterday - will use literals for the moment.
*   [Some discussion on const_expr]
*   
*   


# should empty structs be permitted? ([#1222](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1222))



*   DS: My question here is ‚Äúare these useful?‚Äù. I kind of get Kai‚Äôs point. So I‚Äôm ok with having them.
*   DS: As long as there is no issue with generating them in SPIR-V. I don‚Äôt know if it is possible. This came up because it crashed on NVIDIA.
*   DM: Is it going to be a problem with the host size? Doesn‚Äôt it require us to support zero-sized bindings?
*   DS: So it is restricted to only between shader stages. Not host sharable.
*   Resolved: As above.


# WGSL: Use `let` instead of `var`? ([#1234](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1234))



*   DS: It is only ‚Äúvar‚Äù because I couldn‚Äôt describe it well enough to David at the time.
*   KN: I think david liked var because it implied that it was storage.
*   DS: But we can make that a rule for let. The only difference in JS is scoping.
*   KN: I have always said that we should go in the direction of our host language, in this case JS and thus ‚Äúlet‚Äù (module tradeoffs)
*   DM: Isn‚Äôt this a bit confusing, to have a ‚Äúlet‚Äù without an initializer at the global scope?
*   KN: JS allows this.
*   DM: Weirdly confusing. How do you feel about ‚Äúlet‚Äù in local scope, and ‚Äúvar‚Äù at the global scope.
*   DJ: In JS it doesn't matter, it‚Äôs if it‚Äôs scoped or not. JS is the host language, so maybe we should follow that, but don‚Äôt care either way.
*   DM: Trying to mimic JS could lead us on weird path for the shading language. Weak stance is to follow Rust.
*   KN: Follow rust as `const`->`let` and `var` -> ???
*   DM: Replace `const` by `let` at local scope. Const in local scope is different from const at module scope, so a tension to resolve.
*   KN: Talked about 3 different things for constexpr. Const could mean constexpr, let for non-constexpr values and var as is.
*   DJ: The fact everyone describes in terms of another language and which language you choose is a different thing, we need to decide whats most appropriate here
*   GR: If understanding correctly, Let means const in Rust and not in JS. That seems like a good reason to avoid altogether.
*   KN: Let means the same thing in every language except for JS. Not a good reason either as our host language is JS.
*   DJ: Is there any confusion sticking with Var. That seems like the easy thing.
*   DS: In modern JS, you‚Äôre pushed to let instead of var.
*   DJ: Which is due to weird scoping rules which you have to be aware of in JS.
*   ?: If you expect WGSL var to work like JS var (larger scope than JS let), you will get an error and be corrected.
*   KN: [that + the fact that `let` means `const` in many languages is a] Fair argument for keeping var.
*   DM: Great
*   KN: Keep const as is and come back when we have constexpr.
*   


# Out-of-bounds clamping brings big perf regression on TFJS ML demos. ([#1202](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1202))



*   KN: Basically, folks at Intel working on TF.js saw a big perf loss when turning on our robustness pass in Dawn. I think it was on D3D12 backend.
*   DS: They tested both clamping and min?
*   KN: I dont‚Äô think they tested min, because we didn‚Äôt  have it implemented. What they did was look at how FXC translates and it makes an imax and imin instruction. Probably woudln‚Äôt be enough. Telling us a couple things. 1. Probably need to make robustness rules relaxed enough so we can use vulkan robustness rather then requiring implementations making it well defined with clamp. 2. In presence of that, probably need to do some optimization to remove unnecessary clamps in cases where we do use clamps.
*   DM: Are you suggesting ar[4] and using non 0-3 then implementation can silently allow that without warnings? Thats what robustness gives you.
*   KN: Yes.
*   DM: No way to discover from programmer perspective. Weird nonportable behaviour
*   KN: Could have dev option to issue warnings somehow, but we have to achieve performance and don‚Äôt see anyother way to do it. Maybe we can do it with clamps if we have enough analysis to emit unnecessary clamps. But that‚Äôs not a given and is hard. My understanding si range analysis on numbers is hard.
*   RM: Idea of clamp was portability. At least it runs same way everywhere. If we think a different default like picking min or max or something else would be more efficient then fine with changing it for everyone. Unless we have numbers showing that I‚Äôm concerned what we pick is going to be unsafe or have a cost to it. Not clear optimizing clamp will be harder then the other option we want.
*   KN: Right, I don't think optimizing clamp is harder than optimizing min. We expect to replace clamp with min as indexing will be unsigned so we no longer need the clamp
*   GR: Yup.
*   DJ: How can you replace clamp with min?
*   KN: If the index types in WGSL are unsigned we do a unsigned min with the length before using ti to do the index in the generated code
*   DJ: And that‚Äôs faster then clamp? \
KN: Don‚Äôt have an answer to that. Probably faster in some clases. FXC makes clamp imax + imin. Wasn‚Äôt that the intent? Didnt‚Äô WGSL already make the indices unsigned to allow min instead of clamp.
*   DS: I believe we talked about it but I don‚Äôt know if spec text was written.
*   KN: We also need to know what the numbers look like with min vs clamp. But, regardless of min or clamp this is an early indicator that perf will not be good enough.
*   RC: Were the perf issues on windows?
*   KN: I think they checked on windows on D3D and Vulkan.
*   RC: On windows, unless a root constan buffer you should be getting robust buffer access
*   KN: What does that mean in D3D12?
*   RC: A descriptor where you give it a size then RB access. For computek shaders you get 0 and for vertices you get alpha 1.0 or something like that.
*   KN: So well defined?
*   RC: Yes. As long as it‚Äôs same defined with other APIs we should pick that
*   KN: Vulkan is looser.
*   RC: What does vulkan say?
*   KN: 0, 1, -1, inf, nan. Any value inside allocation could be returned. Basically anything but safely.
*   RC: That means safely but not portability guarantees
*   KN: May not be able to get perf without going there
*   RC: If you do vulkan robust buffer do you get perf issues? What‚Äôs delta?
*   DM: Like 50% of the app
*   KN: We may have it always on. They have 2 columns, enable and disable RBA. Pretty sure vulkan RBA is on in both columns, and difference is if transform is applied. Don‚Äôt know perf of Vulkan RBA but it should be better then clamping, but no worse.
*   DM: Different issues. Local array clamping vs robustness on the binding array indexes. Does‚Äôt guard local array access. If understand correctly perf is lost on local array buffer accesses not binding ranges
*   RC: Do we clamp on binding ranges?
*   KN: Yup.
*   DJ: Seems like if we ignore portability reqs, at least D3D12 could not clamp on bound arrays but still needs clamps on everything else. Third point in issue, if we always clamp for write, then could have multiple threads writing to same memory value which is still undefined.
*   KN: That came up before, but you can do that anyway.
*   DM: Really like D3D12 semantics. Mini dream for webgpu is to follow d3d12 semantics. Including local arrays. So we insert code to discard write or return 0 for read on everything. On d3d12 you can omit the code. On Vulkan can use robustness2 which is the same as d3d12
*   KN: Is it as strict as d3d12? \
DM: I believe so
*   KN: Didn‚Äôt realize that
*   RC: One caveat robustness is applied if given a descriptor with a size. Some APIs where there is no size and it does not help you. All new apis like mesh and ray tracing all given a buffer address and no clamping. Some cases in the future where we have to do something. Sometimes it saves you and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. In the future we‚Äôll have to save the developers themselves, we should pick the most efficient ones evne when we don‚Äôt need it. When it does save us we can omit it, but when it does‚Äôt it‚Äôs efficient.
*   RM: Curious, in a typical shader, how many of these checks can we elimient with range analysis? In my experience, returns working on this type of analysis is decreasing. Naive approach find lots of things, finding all of them is super hard. Typically we have text for entire shader can optimize across functions. Should be possible to, not a perfect job, but good enough to eliminate many of these checks. Don‚Äôt know how hard or how much it saves us.
*   KN: This inner loop they have with 2 nested loops going from 0-4 and inner 0-4. That‚Äôs the most common case. The body of the loops are guarded by inner_rows &lt; 4 inner_cols &lt; 4 and if these were unsigned it would be easy to omit the clamps entirely. Maybe that is the majority of the problem. Maybe range analysis can solve the majority of the analysis for us. We should find out, but I think it will require unsigned numbers. Harder to now signed integer &lt; 4 is a valid index.
*   DM: Sounds like we can say this  is block on someone doing range analysis prototype in Tint or Naga and see if that helps
*   KN: I think that‚Äôs what needs to be done. We implemented robustness pass in the first place.
*   DN: In the meantime we can suggest not do multi-dimensional arrays. That woudl speed up by a factor of 2.
*   KN: They already turned off robustness for testing until we‚Äôve fixed some problems.
*   KN: I‚Äôll write up a response.
*   DJ: Does D3D have plans to add robust buffer to local arrays?
*   GR: Not at this time, I don‚Äôt know of any plans.
*   RC: For the bindings, been told the trend is to not have help. Continue with no robust buffer access. You‚Äôre safe that the memory accessed is part of process.
*   DJ: Right, similar in metal. Doesn‚Äôt help us that much.
*   RC: Unless each WebGPU gets own GPU process.
*   GR: DXC does the same as FXC and replaces clamp with min + max.
*   KN: Good to know. In order to write range analysis we can do it for signed integers but if indexing were unsigned, or allowed unsigned, we could implementat  it simpler since unsigned numbers have a slightly simpler analysis.
*   GR: Switching to unsigned we remove max calcls. Don‚Äôt see reason to do that, only time using negative index is using pointers and we don‚Äôt have that.
*   KN: Only problem is you have to type the u.
*   DS: Can have spec say that it‚Äôs >=0.
*   KN: We have for int now. Could write uint(i)
*   RM: If it starts non-negative and we only add we can expect any range analysis to conclude it‚Äôs positive..
*   KN: Yes, but harder. Want to prototype for speed determination. When prototyping may just ignore integers can be negative and run on targeted shaders where it doesn‚Äôt matter. Just seeing value is &lt; 4 and dropping clamp is easy. Seeing increment is harder, or seems harder. Plus we have goal of the compiler doing as little as possible and making indices unsigned would lower the burden on the compiler.
*   RM: I think it‚Äôs reasonable. In this particular case could likely do a good job even with signed.
*   KN: I think that‚Äôs true of most cases.
*
