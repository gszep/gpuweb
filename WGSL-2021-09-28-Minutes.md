# ‚è≥ Timeboxes


### [wgsl: remove ignore, add phony-assignment #2127](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2127)



* **DN to reword PR as per previous meeting**
* MM: It does feel weird to me to do `_ = texture` to mark static use instead of `ignore(texture)`
* JG: IIRC there‚Äôs no special sauce in our builtin ignore, so it could be a user function? (though it would have to be e.g. `ignore_texture()`)
* BC: Go has _ =.  It‚Äôs a sink for values.
* DM: Can‚Äôt we do `let foo = texture`?
* ??: I think we require let-able types to be constructable
* MM: If I want my buffer to be static use, you‚Äôd want to say `_ = my_buffer`, which we can‚Äôt do today
* ‚Ä¶
* JG: Could we not just also wave the magic wand and waive requirement for underscore assignment to be e.g. constructable, which would allow this.
* DN: We 
* JG: Maybe acceptable if not very satisfying? Least bad here?
* 
* MM: underscore has a problem because it‚Äôs unnatural to write  _ = texturething.
* DM: But ignore would need the same amount of magic (e.g. ignore(buffer)).  So may as well have the magic in one place: put it all in the _ rule.
* JG: Alright, **previous resolution stands then: Replace ignore with _ and make _ sufficiently magical.**


### [precise_math attribute on functions #2080](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2080)



* (Previously: MM: Let‚Äôs postpone.)
* DM: Offline, discussed MSL‚Äôs clang::optnone, which is on function scope.  Kai noted it‚Äôs a big hammer and may not do what‚Äôs wanted.
* MM: I thought we postponed this until after MVP.
* DM: New information came up.
* MM: Would like to re-propose postpone to MVP.  That attribute is not part of the Metal API. So you can‚Äôt rely on it. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good solution.
* DM: Other idea is to expose a function that shields optimizations across its argument vs. its result.  Think we can implement it well on all backends.  (NoContract on SPIR-V, or select trick as discussed on the issue.)
* MM: Not familiar with the technique, and I didn‚Äôt prepare; think it was a mistake to put this on the agenda.
* DN: Also think this can be postponed until after MVP. Have workaround, even if it‚Äôs in the ‚Äúlore‚Äù category.
* JG: Will mark as milestone Post-V1.


### [ Request for compute: anyInvocation() and allInvocation() #2137 ](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2137)



* MM: These functions are no better or works than the other functions that we kicked out of MVP.  No reason to take them in.
* MOD: These also depend on the active mask. So same issues plague it as the whole subgroup feature discussed earlier.
* JG: Can **postpone**.
* GR: Is Invocation a wave or warp or quad?
* MM: A thread
* GR: +1 for postpone then
* MM: This is a good feature that we want, we just have more work to do here before we can ship it.

 


### [–°larify rounding #2140](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2140)



* JG: Is this reasonable?
* DN: It‚Äôs wishing for something we don‚Äôt have. We can‚Äôt really narrow it down below two rounding modes.
* JG: Should we just list the two?
* DN: Plausible? Would like to see data. Those are the most common two, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure if that‚Äôs enough.
* **Needs Investigation**
* **DN to also review current PR**

# ‚öñÔ∏è Discussions


### [wgsl: Add limits section, and "spurious" failure #1997 ](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1997) 



* DM: Helpful to think of concrete situations. E.g. auto-tuning compute shader.  What do they to today. They get out of memory, generally. They react and rewrite their shader until it succeeds.  How can the user do better by returning a ‚Äúspurious‚Äù failure rather than ‚Äúout of memory‚Äù.
* DM: should pass through the out of memory.  Don‚Äôt think our heuristics are going to add value.
* JG: isn‚Äôt ‚Äúspurious‚Äù slightly more ergonomic? Why induct new users into the lore of ‚Äúsometimes your shader doesn‚Äôt compile‚Äù.  It‚Äôs extraordinarily likely that it‚Äôs not really out of memory.  More likely just an issue we found.  I would like to pretend to do better.  This could save multiple people dealing with bug reports ‚Äúhey it says out of memory but it‚Äôs not actually out of memory‚Äù. ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs just a failure to compile‚Äù.  I‚Äôve had to rescue things from investigation and triage for issues that were reported with out of memory.  I‚Äôd feel better saying ‚ÄúGeneric error‚Äù.  It‚Äôs better to have *less* information. Saying ‚Äúout of memory‚Äù is actually deceptive, even when the underlying implementation said out of memory.
* MM: 1. Think the motivation is that some limits are not surfaced well; you only know about them when you hit them. This occurs when the program satisfies all the browser‚Äôs checks, but the platform API fails to compile. In the Metal case this yields an NSError, with some string information.  So this spurious thing make sense in this case.  E.g. used too many registers, or function calls nested too deeply. For us, we‚Äôd yield ‚Äúspurious‚Äù for this NSError case.  Should be rare, unless you hit one of these limits. So we like the functionality.
* MM: 2. For a case where you nested an expression too deeply, but ‚Äúspurious‚Äù is misleading. As if trying again in a few seconds might succeed.  More like ‚Äúimplementation limit exceeded‚Äù. 
* GR: Agree name is bad.  Good case for driver bugs.  Another use case is when there are limits that can‚Äôt be well articulated.   ‚Äúinternal error‚Äù is common for compiler world.
* DM: We have a few categories.  User reacts differently.  E.g. rewrite your shader, or file a bug to the browser / platform.
* GR: Is there a debug layer that will help you get more info.  That would be nice.
* DM: Does the new kind of error carry extra detail in a message?
* DN: Sympathetic that a user can have two different actions: rewrite shader, or file a bug. But  it‚Äôs not clear to determine which action to take.
* DM: Ok, got an answer to my use case question.
* JG: Ok, let‚Äôs find a better name than ‚Äúspurious‚Äù, which we all agree to replace.


### [Remove requirement that function / builtin return values are always consumed #2138 ](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2138) 



* DN: I wanted to add guardrails, but it seems to be causing heartache, so I‚Äôm fine dropping this requirement.
* RM: I also think it doesn‚Äôt need to be a requirement. Fine with not making it a rule so long as we can have a warning.
* DM: Let‚Äôs remove the rule.
* MM: Fine with me.  
* MM: WGSL/WebGPU should have a mechanism to yield warnings.
* DM: To do a nice job, it‚Äôs nontrivial analysis to determine if function has side effects, and only warn when the function has no side effects.
* MM: No, keep it simple:  function result not used.  As long as we have the _
* JG: The bar is lower for warnings.  If you don‚Äôt like the warnings, you have workaround with _ *and* can control warnings.
* DM: I don‚Äôt like false positives. Authors will turn them off, and they lose utility. Or complex control for turning off specific warnings.
* JG: They aren‚Äôt false positives (?)
* DM: They‚Äôre not false positives on atomics.
* JG: Leaves room to adjust warnings based on feedback. E.g. stop generating them for atomic functions.
* MM: Warnings are not standardized.  
* JG: I think I proposed a mechanism for warnings, 
* MM: Can write them to the console, as a last resort?
* JG: Shader module compilation information.  [https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#shader-module-compilation-information](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#shader-module-compilation-information) 
* **Resolved: Remove requirement to consume return values**
