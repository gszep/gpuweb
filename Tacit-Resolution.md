Non-editorial spec changes may be nominated by the Spec Editors for "tacit resolution". By this process, the editors propose a solution to an issue, place it in the "tacit resolution queue", surface it at the next standardization meeting, and then land it if there are no comments in the meeting or pull request by the end of the week.
