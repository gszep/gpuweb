## Define the interface of an entry point in a WGSL program ([#774](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/774))



*   DN:  Stack of PRs: 1093 (approved 2 weeks ago modulo ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù -> ‚Äústorage‚Äù); 1142 (overview of shader interface; pipeline inputs and outputs; builtin variables) which is receiving review attention from Dan and Dzmitry; and yet-to-be written to add buffer and texture resources, and location counting.
*   DN: 1093 has been updated for that rename.
*   DS: I‚Äôll take one last look before merging.

Should WGSL support unicode identifiers? ([#1160](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1160))



*   MD: Many languages support this; very beneficial to support in identifiers and source code as well.
*   DS: Previously defined source code is utf8, so in theory you could do comments with unicode. With Unicode identifiers, we‚Äôd have to normalize them the same for function names that are entrypoints.
*   KN: Should be able to just use the plain unicode strings
*   MM: Four levels of options:
    *   1. Don‚Äôt do it for anything
    *   2. Unicode just for var names but not anything else
    *   3. Unicode for everything for everything except entrypoint names
    *   4. Unicode for all items, and everything has to normalize the same way.
*   DS: (4) but after MVP
*   MM: Think I agree. Not super important now.
*   DM: entrypoint names as well?
*   DS: Yea, weird inconsistencies if mixed.
*   ‚Ä¶
*   KN: Still want to hash in the backend output
*   DS: Right but that‚Äôs up to the backend
*   MM: Counterargument - homographs - characters that look the same but are not. Could be annoying. Maybe a 5th level is allow unicode but only some of it.
*   KN: Someone pointed out that unicode has some rules about identifiers so maybe we can use that. But I don‚Äôt think we should do anything special about this.
*   JG: I expect to be annoyed by this, but given JS supports unicode we should support it too.
*   MM: Also if you‚Äôll need font fallback, which would break your monospace text editor
*   DM: Implementation side, presumably we wouldn‚Äôt use unicode entrypoints and won‚Äôt pass directly
*   JG/KN: Don‚Äôt pass that directly in WebGL anyway.
*   MM: Source string can‚Äôt be in dest because of cross-site considerations. [https://xkcd.com/327/](https://xkcd.com/327/)
*   KN: Yea should just hash.
*   MD: Wasm defines unicode separately. Maybe someone could look into why.
*   JG: Sounds like WASM has a good reason. Limitations of binary format.
*   DS: ok - agreed yes post MVP. We can figure out specifics later.


## Operator Precedence (Umbrella ‚òÇÔ∏è issue [#1146](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1146))



*   Reorder expression sections ([#1136](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1136))
    *   **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Quick Links</span>**
        *   **Precedence before:**
            *   **[gpuweb/pull/1111#issue comment-707941325 üîó](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1111#issuecomment-707941325)**
        *   **Used to match:** HLSL, GLSL, C++
        *   **Precedence after:**
            *   **[gpuweb/pull/1111#issuecomment-705039742 üîó](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1111#issuecomment-705039742)**
        *   **Matches:** Python, Swift, Rust
        *   **What‚Äôs different:** Bitwise ops get higher precedence
    *   **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Discussion</span>**
        *   KN: C has strange operator precedence, rooted in the fact that C is old and also didn‚Äôt have booleans. So there‚Äôs weird precedence in other languages like bitwise and comparisons.
        *   KN: I‚Äôve proposed a partially-ordered operator precedence. (**v2b** in [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12O2bAB1FqjMx7BnM5uE7P48Xd4sHE3qq6MhXGwJuaG4/edit#slide=id.g53c6cbdbe8_0_611)) Tried to get rid of every ambiguous case and leaves us with what I think is a very consistent precedence. Consistent with modern languages and with C. Should eliminate confusion between WGSL and GLSL or WGSL and Swift/Rust
        *   DN: I like it.
        *   RM: It‚Äôs also very .. that if we find out that we actually want more ordering we can always add it later. Removing it is less possible.
        *   MM: If you wanted to turn this flow chart into a grammar - is it representable, or would it need host parsing checks.
        *   KN: It‚Äôs definitely possible in the general sense of a parser. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible in the type of specific grammar we‚Äôre trying to build.
        *   RM: I expect it should work. I will try to verify this. I anticipate any issues will be fine.
        *   DM: Any reason the bitshifts aren‚Äôt separated?
        *   KN: They could be, though I think it‚Äôs fairly clear how they behave.
        *   DM: I would be worried about it.
        *   MD: How would we display it as a table.
        *   Various: Just put the picture in the spec.
        *   DC: Looking at the bitshifts - are they lower priority than x+y? 
        *   KN: Not valid to do x+y&lt;<z. That would be a compiler error.
        *   DC: Shouldn‚Äôt they be at the same level of * / %?
        *   KN: They technically are. 
        *   DS: Next step: Robin will try to make proposed v2b as a grammar. 
        *   DS: Split the bitshifts for now.
        *   KN: Can‚Äôt do x &lt;< y &lt;< z
        *   DS: Can‚Äôt do x & y | z either?
        *   KN: no you can‚Äôt, but you can x & y & z
        *   DN: I think we need a table.
        *   JG: And examples might be the best form of clarity.
*   Introduce operator precedence table ([#1111](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1111))
*   Partially-ordered precedence ([comment on #1146](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1146#issuecomment-708075785))
    *   KN: [proposed partial ordering](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12O2bAB1FqjMx7BnM5uE7P48Xd4sHE3qq6MhXGwJuaG4/edit#slide=id.g53c6cbdbe8_0_611)


## Placement of read_only attribute ([#1159](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1159))



*   DS: trying to figure out read_only for buffers and then for textures. This issue is all of the proposed ways to do it. I believe I prefer option 7.
*   DS: Comes down to:
    *   remove read_only write_only from textures? makes it an attribute
    *   then do we put the attribute on the variable? left or right? (I prefer left where it‚Äôs part of attribute instead of type)
*   DN: So if you want to pass a texture into a function, how do you determine the set of overloads? if I have a read only storage texture, and read_only is on the var, and I pass that into a function, does read_only have to be annotated on the parameter separately from the type? And if the callee needs to do something different in codegen?
*   MM: I‚Äôd like overload resolution to be a function of types, and not anything else.
*   DN: I agree
*   DS: That works if we put it on the other side of the colon - the right side in the function
*   MM: Yes that‚Äôs what I prefer.
*   DM: Does that match array strides when we pass arrays around?
*   DS: Yes.
*   DN: So basically read_only becomes a type attrib and gets carried through type aliases. So you can do: \
type RTArr = [<!-- -->[stride 16]] array&lt;vec4&lt;f32>>; \
type ro_buf = [<!-- -->[read_only]] Buf;
*   MM: What‚Äôs the reason for Possible 2 over putting _ro_ inside the type name.
*   DS: How do you do that with structured buffers? The type is ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù so where do you put the read_only?
*   DM: Could do struct_ro / struct_wo.
*   MM: Oh so new keywords.
*   DS: Yes. You can either put RO on the struct def, or put it on the type when you assign to var, or change the name to struct_ro. Can‚Äôt think of another way.
*   JG: block_ro ?
*   DM: I like the ability to specify access qualifiers near the type but not a suffix. It is consistent and extendable. Possible 2 doesn‚Äôt mention anything about textures
*   DS: Textures would be the same as Possible 1.
*   DS: We could even make [<!-- -->[sampled]] and attrib too..
*   DM: I think that should be part of the type. No reason to hide it from the type. They already differ in requiring texel format for storage image, vs. sampled component type for sampled image..
*   JG: If this were an attribute on a type.. do we have type aliases?
*   DS: Yes.
*   JG: Is this something you can typedef
*   DS: Yes.
*   DM: If you have a storage thing, we have to require the access to be specified. Vulkan default is read/write. We probably want the users to always tell us the access. Writing in the spec that you have to put one of the attribs is a little inelegant. 
*   DS: I was thinking read/write is default and one of ro wo limits it.
*   DM: So you want users to get read write textures by accident? That‚Äôs an extension.
*   DC: Default readonly?
*   JG: How do you describe writeonly in that case? it would really be [<!-- -->[write_instead]]
*   DM: I was thinking like what metal has. You have the access attribute and you specify the..
*   DS: But then you have to always provide it? what happens if you don‚Äôt.
*   DM: Error on creation 
*   DS: So we can do [<!-- -->[readable, writable]] buffer, and if you don‚Äôt provide either it‚Äôs an error?
*   DN: When I think of sampled images, you can only do it in a certain way - readable. So i do think we should treat sampled different from storage. Now because we already have two different ways of handling sampled and storage textures, I think it‚Äôs ok to have a diff way to describe how buffers are accessed. I think storage textures can have explicit read, explicit write,m and one day read write. \
For buffers I‚Äôm okay with default RW as that‚Äôs how people usually think.
*   MM: Sounds compelling to me.
*   DM: For WebGPU it makes a big different if something is readonly or R/W. We make different tradeoffs. I like the idea of readonly by default. If you want more, you say what you want to do. Aside from that, I was thinking [<!-- -->[access(read_write)]] buf which matches metal. You have to provide some access qualifier.
*   .. does it affect multi Q - no.
*   DS: access(read_write) just seems like more typing.
*   DM: But it would be specified differently. You must specify ‚Äúaccess‚Äù vs you must say A or A/B.
*   MS: What about writable and writeonly? That would give you the readonly default.
*   MM: Writeable is both? for textures?
*   MS: For buffers for now.
*   JG: Weird when the unstated default is a limited one, and then trying‚Ä¶ or well those look like modifiers for the default. If the default is readonly, it‚Äôs weird to modify that with writeonly. You;re actually replacing the modifier, not adding it.
*   DS: I think the answer is you must provide one. And later we can relax that. Can‚Äôt go the other way.
*   DS: Could leave textures as they are now and just change buffers.
*   MM: Intuitively, I‚Äôd expected sampled-textures to be common and makes sense for them to be the default. For buffers I could see arguments on both sides for the default. So idk what do do about there, but I do think textures can be sampled by default.
*   DN: To understand. For 1D texture, we‚Äôre have the same ..
*   DS: Don‚Äôt have modifiers on sampled textures, they‚Äôre just sampled_texture.
*   DN: Was going to argue that for storage textures, readonly and writeonly are like template params. If it‚Äôs essential to the behavior to the type then it‚Äôs a type template parameter. \
For storage textures:
    *   texture_2d&lt;read,rgba32float>
    *   texture_2d&lt;write,rgba32float>
*    MS: If you‚Äôre going to require something for buffers, it makes sense to just have [<!-- -->[read]] and [<!-- -->[write]] and you need at least one.
*   DS: So [<!-- -->[access(read, write]] or [<!-- -->[access(read)]]
*   MM: Can we just accept this and see how it goes? Sampled textures by default and buffers requiring write or read.
*    DM: Against the sampled texture by default. They‚Äôre just different and specifying it is asking for trouble for no reason. \
"[<!-- -->[read_only]] texture_1d&lt;rgba32float>" should be a different type from "texture_1d&lt;f32>", I think
*   DS:
```
    var ro_tex :  texture_1d&lt;read, rgba32float>;
    var tex : texture_sampled_1d&lt;f32>
    [[block]] struct Buffer {
        [[offset(0)]] a : i32;
    };
    [[binding(0), set(0)]]
    var &lt;storage> buf : [[access(read)]] Buffer;
```
*    DS: Or swap this so texutre_ is sampled and storage_texture is the longer one
*    Code snippet in chat:
```
    Dan Sinclair4:10 PM
    var ro_tex :  texture_storage_1d&lt;read, rgba32float>;
    var tex : texture_1d&lt;f32>
    
    [[block]] struct Buffer {
      [[offset(0)]] a : i32;
    };
    [[binding(0), set(0)]]
    var &lt;storage> buf : [[access(read)]] Buffer;
```


## what is the initial value of a workgroup variable? ([#1137](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1137))



*   DN: I messed up in the original. in VUlkan workgroup variables are NOT allowed to have an initializer. So if we agree on 0 then that‚Äôs all good.
*   DN: As it stands today, an impl on this on Vk would have to inject extra code into the shader to do the zero init. Painful b.c. you need to write code that works no matter how big the dispatch size is, and then a barrier.. and then the user part of the shader. The impl has to do this.
*   CW: Experience from ANGLE ES3.1 that doing this efficiently was not trivial to impl, but we don‚Äôt really have a choice.
*   JG: Any pattern we can use to detect when we don‚Äôt need to do the extra work? If the user wants to initialize to 1‚Äôs, are we going to init to 0 and then init to 1.
*   MM: Won‚Äôt the driver get rid of the clear to 0?
*   KN: Not trivial because it could be a cooperative thing between multiple shader invocations.
*   JG: Then, if we can detect it, can we force people to do it? Spec-wise it‚Äôs not so different because specs are as-if.
*   KN: If they want all 1, maybe we can let them pass that.
*   KN: In general I don‚Äôt think we can reliably detect when a shader initializes everything.
*   MM: In metal there‚Äôs local thread group variables and there are pointers that point to shared memory that‚Äôs arbitrarily sized.
*   DN: This is about the first kind.
*   JG: I like the idea of asking the user what they want it initialized to - but couldn‚Äôt a form of that be to require workgroup vars to be initialized?
*   DN: Right, what we have in other things is that if it doesn‚Äôt have an initializer, we will do it for you to 0.
*   MM: One of the goals here is portability. Simply saying that it needs an initializer is problematic because shaders could write different things.
*   JG: constexpr.
*   MM:So all threadgroup variables are globals?
*   Yes.
*   JG: I like the idea of an optional initializer and if you don‚Äôt provide we zero it like everything else.
*   MM: Metal has a cool feature where previous dispatches can share the storage. So you can kick off a dispatch beforehand. Not sure if other APIs have that.
*   Nope.
*   JG: sounds like we need some portable value for initialization. If we can init to 0‚Äôs then it would be cool if we could initialize to something else as well. Would be bad if we got an extension in the future that made it easy to 0. If we claim this, we can‚Äôt change the behavior in the future.
*   MM: IIRC, this group was discussing clear colors, and if the type of the texture is an integer or floating point texture, you have to use different types. If we allow a sentinel other than 0, we‚Äôre going to have the same types of problems where the type of the field has to match the type in the shader which is a little yucky. Feel like we should just do 0. If there‚Äôs an initializer we can have an optimization and behave as-if.
*   DN: I prefer 0. Haven‚Äôt seen an initializer as a use case. Could consider post MVP. To be clear: I would like no initializer, and always make it 0.
*   MM: Non threadgroup vars can have initializers, right?
*   DN: In private and functions yes.
*   MM: So what‚Äôs the argument to not allow?
*   DN: Because it‚Äôs shared scratch space, it‚Äôs no so clear how it would be done.
*   MM: If it‚Äôs constexpr, presumably it‚Äôs the same.
*   DN: 0 may be easier for an impl to do because of the type problem you were talking about. memset vs actual values.
*   DN: impl could chop up the space for initialization, and zero it cooperatively. Could be an array. You don‚Äôt know how big it‚Äôll be necessarily.
*   KN: Yes this is the most common use case.
*   MM: Do we support initializers in the module scope for arrays?
*   DN: Yes, we do.
*   MM: Right so one thread would fill in one segment of the array.
*   DM: This is just something we have to do. It‚Äôs not a feature. I would like the mechanics to be an impl detail. Maybe there will be a Vulkan extension to clear to 0. If everyone starts to init to non zero we wouldn‚Äôt be able to go the fast path.
*   DM: API doesn‚Äôt tell the choice of fast/slow.
*   DM: Can also be a feature for after MVP.
*   MM: If we have all this code, we might as well just let people pass a value.
*   CW: I made a proposal for such an extension. Because zeros are the same representation for every type there‚Äôs a clear fast path. The rest is more complicated.
*   JG: True. no one is arguing that most people want 0 and will be fastest. But it would suck if you wanted the flexibility of not zero and the impl already has the ability to do it. If they provide an initializer, we can do the slow thing to the custom value. But it would be faster than us doing fast 0 and the user doing slow custom value.
*   MM: I‚Äôd be uncomfortable accepting an argument that says there might be a Vk extension sometime in the future. We can move one. Let‚Äôs just accept 0 for now.


## Entry point taking in/out as parameters ([#1155](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1155))



*   DS: Came out of me writing WGSL and getting annoyed that in/out were the same between vertex and fragment. Would be nice to not have two declarations. DM proposed entrypoint params instead.
*   MM: Did we discuss this a few days ago? I thought we agreed you can‚Äôt have buffers as arguments to helper functions.
*   DS: Right so it wouldn‚Äôt work for buffers.
*   DS: \
[location(0)]] var&lt;out(vertex), in(fragment)> frag_color : vec4&lt;f32> \
OR \
[<!-- -->[location(0, fragment), location(1, vertex)]] var&lt;in(vertex), out(fragment)> colour : vec4&lt;f32>
*   MM: Can I try to describe another way of phrasing your proposal: \
If I wrote a naive program, I‚Äôd have one var that‚Äôs an output from vertex and input to fragment. Your proposal says to deduplicate them.
*   DS: Yes, but in the naive version you also need to have different names. This lets the names match up.
*   DN: So if I‚Äôm in the middle of a helper function that accesses the variable, I need to know if it‚Äôs been called from the vertex or fragment function. That‚Äôs what the storage class tells me.
*   DS: True.
*   DN: Right now it‚Äôs a unique name and look up the usage right away.
*   DS: In SPIR-V we need to list the ids on the entrypoint so we need to know if the helper is in vertex or fragment.
*   DN: ...
*   MM: When you do variable name lookups, don‚Äôt you start at an entrypoint and already know what entrypoint you‚Äôre in?
*   DS: In Tint that depends on if you‚Äôre outputting the entire module or a single entrypoint. We don‚Äôt necessarily track if it‚Äôs the entire module. We only deduplicate the function if it uses global vars that are different.
*   ‚Ä¶ and would need to generate two copies of the function if used from two different stages.
*   MM: Which you would have had to done anyway. So seems like there‚Äôs no downside and only upside?
*   DN: I think it looks way more complicated.
*   DS: Maybe the answer is we leave it for post MVP. Mostly thought of it because I was writing the same thing a lot. In other APIs you usually don‚Äôt write everything in one file.
*   DM: I think it‚Äôs a problem and we should solve it, but what Dan suggests is indeed complicated. I think we should have inputs and outputs as args. and bindings are global.
*   MM: Does that solve this? Doesn‚Äôt let you use the same thing for in and out. because output is a struct and input is multiple args.
*   DS: The entrypoint way would work. I just don‚Äôt want to type multiple different names for the same thing.
*   MM: The idea Kai was referring to - putting the struct as a param as both the input and as an output. That‚Äôs what I did for WSL, but I regretted it. It‚Äôs not a real struct it just holds params you didn‚Äôt want to type. The compiler had to pack/unpack from this struct for not much benefit.
*   KN: Right you need location bindings on the struct members so it‚Äôs special.
*   DM: That‚Äôs how it looks in Metal, SPIR-V and HLSL - or at least it‚Äôs an option.
*   MM: Also, I regretted this because in the WSL compiler there‚Äôs this fake struct, but I defined it so it could be nested. If we limit it to not nested, it might solve the concern.
*   DM: I think both SPIR-V and MSL limit to depth 1.
*   DN: For I/O? I don‚Äôt think SPIR-V limits it.
*   MM: Code to fill in members of the struct was complicated enough that it didn‚Äôt seem worth it.
*   MM: Q about Dan‚Äôs proposal: what happens when WebGPU adds tessellation shaders or mesh shaders and stuff like that.
*   KN: I think Dan‚Äôs proposal makes it quite simple because it‚Äôs just one variable that represents two different variables depending on which stage you‚Äôre in, so it‚Äôs straightforward to understand what happens. You can reuse as appropriate between different stages if you had a geo shader in the middle.
*   DS: And the proposal doesn‚Äôt make it required. It‚Äôs only if you want multiple do you need the stages.
*   DN: Tessellation has a weird thing where per stage is different from per patch. Quite subtle. Not 1-1. Maybe in that case you don‚Äôt share and that‚Äôs ok. Patch variables would be 1-1, but non-patch wouldn‚Äôt be.
*   DS: People like structs better than this for inputs/outputs?
*   MM: Required? Can I have some in a struct and some globals.
*   DS: I‚Äôd say it would have to be a struct.
*   DM: Some of the outputs could be pipeline-specific like builtins so you want them outside the struct.
*   DS: So you have a fragment struct, and vertex struct.
*   KN: Or no struct on the input side.
*   MM: Seems like the simple thing would be inputs as args, and they can have one layer of struct
*   DS: And there wouldn‚Äôt be globals. It‚Äôs either in the struct or in the param list. 
*   MM: Yea, we probably shouldn‚Äôt have both params and globals, but if we pick params, it‚Äôs probably okay to have one layer deep of a struct. \
If we want it to be not globals, the vertex shader returns three varyings, and those need to be inputs to the fragment shader.
*   DN: Okay, so we‚Äôre using the return of a struct value return multiple things.
    *   Example:
```
    [[stage(vertex)]] fn myvertexShader(
        [[location(0)]] a: i32, 
        [[location(1)]] b:f32) 
    -> ( [[location(0)]] outa: i32, [[location(1)]] outb: f32) {
            outa = 2*a;
            outb = 2*b;
        }
    // because this is an entry point, outa and outb are as if declared as var&lt;out>.
    // So they are default-zero-initialized and we can read and write to them.
    // If we think about extending this to helper functions, then after-arrow
    // declarations are ‚Ä¶ an open question because now they might be the RHS of an
    // assignment in the caller.
```
*   DN: We could have an arrow to a list of named tuple parameters..
*   MM: Helper functions?
*   DS: Okay I‚Äôll write up the struct proposal and we can discuss at the next meeting.
