# ‚è≥ Timeboxes


### [wgsl: Add vector and matrix constructor overloads that infer component type #2305](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2305)



* DN: On a vector type constructor, one can infer the component type from the arguments, so, let‚Äôs do so. This reduces visual noise when writing literals. This PR adds the overloads. We could do the same for arrays, but that‚Äôs another PR.
* JG: matrices?
* DN: all elements must be the same T.
* JG: So you can have vec(1,1,0,1), but not vec(1,1,0, 0.5)?
* DN: Yes.
* MM: If this is just adding overloads, and not adding new syntax, then this is fine.
* MM: Doing this for arrays will be different from adding overloads, because the compiler will have to get involved.
* DM: We haven‚Äôt had functions before with a generic parameter, but generally I like the idea. But, this is not meant to cover all cases, right?
* DN: No, just vectors and matrices
* DM: Can I create a vec4 from two vec2s? Isn‚Äôt that a lot of overloads?
* DN: yes
* MM: So I can create two vec2s, and then combine them into a vec4, all without ever writing `f32`?
* DN: yes
    * vec4(vec2(1.0,1.0),vec2(2.0,3.0))
    * Is same as    vec4&lt;f32>(vec2&lt;f32>(1.0,2.0),vec2&lt;f32>(2.0,3.0))
* DN: It does not allow vec4(vec2(1,1),vec2(2.0,3.0))
* DN: This is independent of literal type inference.
* JG: It seems like this doesn‚Äôt help people not type .0 all the time, which is the main pain point
* MM: Should we defer this until next week?
* JG: I‚Äôd appreciate the time to think about this for another week
* **RESOLVED: defer until next week**


### [Add compound assignment (e.g. +=), updated](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2345)



* DN: Robin wrote a PR, but we decided not to pursue it. But then James had an idea to resuscitate it, but that actually did end up complicated. So this is a third approach which isn‚Äôt too bad. The reference is calculated *once*, and the spec has an example that illustrates this.
    * myArray[foo()] += 3;     // `foo()` called only once
* RM: It would be nice to have a ‚ÄúNOTE‚Äù explaining how it‚Äôs implemened
* DN: Okay, I‚Äôll revise this and have RM review
* MM: Are we also going to have ++, since we have +=?
* DN: yes
* MM: And only one kind of ++?
* DN: Yes, I propose only suffix
* MM: And ++ is not an expression, so it doesn‚Äôt produce a value, so the prefix/suffix distinction doesn‚Äôt matter
* JG: I subscribe to the Python school of thought, that x += 1 isn‚Äôt really that much more typing. But if there‚Äôs consensus around having it, that‚Äôs okay
* DM: Doesn‚Äôt seem necessary
* MM: It‚Äôs common in other languages, so there‚Äôs a lot of utility in familiarity. And since we‚Äôve got the conceptual overhead of += already, the incremental cost is low.
* JG: People get used to having to type +=. The fact that people use something doesn‚Äôt mean that they need it. But, we can discuss on the PR.
* RM: Would like a non-normative note to capture our previous discussion: how it translates to simpler WGSL for non-vector-componet, and the special case for vector component.
* DN: I‚Äôd like to take another crack at simplifying the writing, so let‚Äôs see how it looks
* **Resolved approved**


### [Add integer increment and decrement statements #2320](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2320)



* DN: There is a PR, but it‚Äôs poorly phrased. I‚Äôd like to rephrase it.
* RM: If the earlier PR is merged, then this can be specified as pure syntactic sugar for that
* DN: I‚Äôll rewrite, pass it by RM
* MM: It‚Äôs not unreasonable to have ++ work on floats, if it‚Äôs easy to specify
* DN: It‚Äôs not easy to specify.
* MM: The ULP of some floats is greater than 1, so +=1 can have no effect, so therefore, we should probably not support ++ on floats, to make it clearer that people are adding a tiny number to a large number.
* DN: It‚Äôs a little more of a footgun, so let‚Äôs not have ++
* JG: There‚Äôs merit to pure syntactic sugar definitions, though.
* DN: It‚Äôs all PDP worship
* JG: It doesn‚Äôt seem necessary
* DM: iteration is the actual need
* JG: we can abbreviate for loops ad nauseum but it doesn‚Äôt establish necessity
* MM: People do use ++ all the time
* JG: but the frequency of something‚Äôs use is not evidence for its necessity. We should weigh the actual quality of life engendered by the feature. Many popular languages don‚Äôt have it
* BC: But every time I trip over its absence, I wonder why it was taken away from me
* JG: People get used to Python.
* MM: Swift doesn‚Äôt have ++, but the reason is that they didn‚Äôt like the prefix/postfix confusion. They do have += because it lacks that ambiguity.
* JG: We solved that by saying it‚Äôs only a statement. If in the future += becomes an expression, then at that point I would really object to ++ as an expression
* MM: I will never want ++ as an expression, no matter what we do with +=
* JG: Well, with my and DM‚Äôs weak objections noted, let‚Äôs look at the revised PR and then accept it
* **ACCEPTED pending revisions**


### [wgsl: for texture coordinates, allow array index be appended to the coordinate vector #2340](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2340)



* DN: This was an offshoot of investigating GPU assembly languages
* DN: Was looking into the origin of the requirement that the texture offsets be integer constants. D3D and Vulkan both allow floats there. Happy to close this with no change as just an investigation.
* TR: D3D does allow integer coordinates, right?
* DN: Yes. WGSL allows only normalized coordinates for sampling operations, and integer (non-normalized) coordinates for texel loads and stores
* **CLOSED: no change**

# ‚öñÔ∏è Discussions


### [Remove [[block]] attribute #2104](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2104)



* DN: All the rules that [[block]] was created to enforce are now enforced in a different way. There is a ‚Äúfixed footprint‚Äù rule: if its memory consumption is determined at pipeline creation time, then it can be used as an array element, and [[block]] is no longer needed. And it‚Äôs nice not to have struct required for globals.
* DM: How are these restrictions enforced now?
* DN: runtime-sized arrays can only appear in the acceptable places now. So you can‚Äôt put a runtime-sized array inside a runtime-sized array.
* MM: Yes, we should get rid of block. Thumbs up.
* MM: I don‚Äôt think this opens the door for not requiring these buffers to hold structs. We could just permit [[block]] on non-struct things.
* MM: The benefit we‚Äôre hoping for from this change would be how we‚Äôre going to get to bindless, sometime. What do we want the user to type to distinguish between a two-dimensional array versus a collection of one-dimensional arrays? I had some suggestions in the PR. We could discuss this after MVP.
* DN: Internally, when Google was discussing this, we were also concerned with preserving a path to bindless.
* MM: We don‚Äôt need to block this on that path. All the ways forward that I came up with involved removing [[block]], so we can certainly do that at this point.
* DM: Yes, the path seems pretty clear.
* **ACCEPTED**
* DN: And if it‚Äôs broken we‚Äôll fix it!


### [Add textureGather, textureGatherComponent, textureGatherCompare. #2341](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2341)



* DN: The functionality is clear, the question is how to capture that functionality as functions. D3D has separate overloads depending on which component is being fetched; the current proposal is to specify the component with a constant expr argument.
* TR: Historically, there was only gather on a single component, because that‚Äôs all the hardware supported. But nowadays there‚Äôs no problem getting the other components, so there‚Äôs no need for the no-component-selector overload.
* DN: For depth textures, you‚Äôd specify 0?
* TR: Yes
* GR: It might be easier to document with the overload?
* JG: The huge number of overloads is a fact of life
* MM: What‚Äôs the problem with overloads? Developer confusion? Compile time?
* TR: Choosing the right overload with the different orderings can be hairy
* GR: It‚Äôs a pain to test all the combinations.
* MM: If you have a depth texture, but the metal shader doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a depth texture, these non-compare gather functions are untested and unlikely to work. If we accept this, then we shouldn‚Äôt accept the decision to delete the depth texture type, because depth textures have a different set of components that one can reasonably request
* JG: Couldn‚Äôt people just apply a color sampler to a depth texture?
* DM: Can you do a gather without comparison on a Metal depth texture?
* MM: Not sure.
* JG: Let‚Äôs specify something, try to implement it, and then see if things break.
* MM: DM‚Äôs proposal to get rid of the WGSL depth texture type, but continue to have it in the WebGPU API, then this problem goes away
* MM: But I definitely think we should have gather functions, in some form. They‚Äôre not super-useful, but they‚Äôre useful.
* DN: How should I change the signatures of these things? Just always require the component, but in some cases it must be zero?
* JG: either having an overload or requiring the component would be fine. Wild idea: put component selector argument first
* TR, GR: That‚Äôs a nice idea
* GR: We shouldn‚Äôt just test things that the spec doesn‚Äôt cover
* JG: Yes, but we have influence over what Apple will add to the spec
* MM: Let‚Äôs accept this PR (modulo reformulations), discuss depth textures later, and then if the conclusions don‚Äôt jive, we can reopen this.
* DM: Checked the spec, it seems like Metal can support this
* JG: Do we have consensus on moving the component selector to the front?
* DM: Yes, but not for the depth textures
* **Revise and acceptd**
