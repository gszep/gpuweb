# ‚è≥ Timeboxes (until 5:30)


### [wgsl: Allow phony assignment of abstract numeric type #2968](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2968)



* DN: No reason to disallow it.  Was a weird corner/ irregularity, when Ben was implementing it.
* AB: Any reason to keep any type restrictions at all?  Maybe runtime arrays might be impossible.
* KG: Should be able to phony assign anything that would be assigned to something else
* AB: Well, it‚Äôs more like allowing ‚Äòconst‚Äô decl.
* KG: Phony should be able to accept anything that you would be able to feed into a ‚Äòconst‚Äô decl.
* MM: Would be unfortunate to have to do the out of bounds check in this case, and force a failure.
* _Approved._


### [Add saturate() or clamp01() #3012](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/3012)



* DN: Someone noticed that it‚Äôs missing from WGSL, and that it exists in e.g. hlsl and MSL and that e.g. AMD has hardware support for this, so I think it‚Äôs worth adding.
* MM: *The* reason for accepting this isn‚Äôt performance, because we can recognize this anyways. The difference is that this should be helping authors, about being nice to authors. I think it should be called saturate and not clamp.
* KG: Also feel should be nice to authors.  Clamp01 makes more sense to me.  ‚ÄòSaturate‚Äô sounds like a self-modifying verb.  Comes down to where we come from in our programming culture.  I‚Äôd have to look up what ‚Äòsaturate‚Äô means. That‚Äôs my vote, but not strongly held.
* KG: Unity have clamp01.: [https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Clamp01.html](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Clamp01.html) (but this isn‚Äôt a shader language)
* GR: Can we have both?
* MOD: Clamp01 reads to me as a different version of ‚Äòclamp‚Äô.  Looks like a version not a function.
* KG: I‚Äôm resigned to it being saturate instead of clamp.  I still would have to go lookup.
* KG: Compiler should translate the idiom   clamp(x,0,1) and translate it to saturate call. 
* _Agreed to ‚Äòsaturate‚Äô_


### [Specify a minimum SizeOf for a runtime array #2997](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2997) 



* DN: Editorial.  Think already exists in totality of text of the specs.


### [Specify that structures compare by name, not by structure. #2994](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2994)



* KG: Structs are not ‚Äúduck‚Äù typed.  It‚Äôs by-name match instead of structural.
* Agree this is the way it is. Make sure spec says it.


### [wgsl: comparison operator result is scalar bool when "is scalar" should expand to include abstract numerics. #2988](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2988)



* editorial


### [wgsl: Other language types in reserved word list #2983](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2983)



* DN:  Bunch of easy cases (like texture types in other languages), an remove them.  But there are some like i16 and i64 that  are on likely path to being in WGSL.
* KG: Agree to reserve those.
* MM: Why. We have a forward path that allows us to add those and have user defined things override WGSL-predeclared-things.  We have to have a solution to that problem.
* AB: That‚Äôs not what the spec says right now.
* KG: Don‚Äôt want to redefine ‚Äòtrue‚Äô ‚Äòfalse‚Äô.
* AB: Agree we need a plan for expansion in that way.
* KG: Need an issue
* DN: [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2941](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2941) , and make that non-editorial.

# ‚öñÔ∏è Discussions


### [WGSL pointer aliasing rules ¬∑ Issue #1457](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1457)



* MM: Internal discussion raised: 
    * If compiler can prove that two pointers don‚Äôt alias, then in some programs the compiler can generate better code around those pointers.
    * If compiler knows two pointers do alias, then compiler can emit better code in some situations.
    * For WGSL we know the whole program. (e.g. could inline the world).  So reason for restrict keyword in C doesn‚Äôt really apply for WGSL.  (There are not multiple compilation units).
    * For that reason, there‚Äôs no good reason to say that a program that has aliasing pointers ever has a reason to behave nonportably. Should treat aliasing pointers that just arises naturally.  Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a large benefit from making that assumption.
    * If there is a read-write-read sandwich then ‚Ä¶
* DN: So the compiler audits far enough that the compiler handles it. Can this ever lead to combinatorial explosion?
* MM: It‚Äôs a trade-off, so the compiler would have to decide. It wouldn‚Äôt *have* to.
* DN: Spir-v has the assumption that there‚Äôs no aliasing, so the compiler would need to protect against aliasing, and emit special aliasable versions.  Could lead to compilation in the browser to explode.
* MM: We were thinking, if you were representing in a language that doesn‚Äôt allow aliasing, you‚Äôd essentially have to de-dupe pointers. Because of logical addressing restrictions, this is probably ok. E.g. &myArray[foo()] vs &myArray[bar()] is tricky but should be possible.
* MM: We‚Äôre not super-sure that it‚Äôs game over, there may be another solution. I understand the point you‚Äôre making, not sure it‚Äôs a deal-breaker?
* AB: I think it‚Äôs also not good in copy-in-copy-out like HLSL. When there *is* aliasing, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe anymore, at least not trivially. I think it‚Äôs scary that we‚Äôd require whole-program analysis for this already. E.g. if we add libraries, we‚Äôd need to pessimize. 
* MM: The sandwich is, a read via one pointer, write via a different pointer, and then read via orig pointer.
* AB: For languages with copy-in copy-out languages, you‚Äôd never see the proper update in that sandwich case.
* MM: What are the current path in folks targeting D3D?
* AB: We emit HLSL, and currently compile FXC.  Too many machines with Windows to ignore.
* MM: Firefox?
* KG: Outside my scope.  Expect similar to Chrome‚Äôs experience/constraints/targets.
* GR: Would be curious what other telemetry indicates. Alan said DX11 is pervasive.  Or, DX12 that does not support DXIL is the interesting case.  Would be interested in comparing notes.  Would be willing to share it.
* AB: Not acceptable to us to limit us to requiring a DXIL backend.  
* GR: As I recall, Google told us that 40% of the DX12 platforms didn‚Äôt support DXIL.  That doesn‚Äôt ring right
* AB: Let‚Äôs talk offline privately.
* KG: In sum, for v1 launch we have languages using in/out semantics, and SPIR-V that assumes no- aliasing.  So would have to do whole program analysis to correctly support the aliased cases.
* MM: **Would like some more time.**
* AB: Think we could pessimize SPIR-V to support, using ‚ÄúAliased‚Äù decoration on all memory object declarations (and maybe intermediate pointers?). My concern is more about languages with inout params.  ‚ÄòAlias‚Äô means ‚Äòmay alias‚Äô with other things. There‚Äôs a whole table describing the interactions.  Additionally, things could get weird if you allowed type punning.	


### [wgsl: document how much of an alignment request is checked by the API #2999](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2999)



* MM: Can we get a better explanation?
* DN: Vector of 4 floats requires a certain alignment requirement. Additionally, author can add @align annotations, and that bubbles out to the outside. 
* _Direction: it‚Äôs about packing data, not about divisors on machine addresses (when that goes beyond the HW alignments on primitive types).  **Take option 3** in [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2999#issuecomment-1148913857](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2999#issuecomment-1148913857) _
