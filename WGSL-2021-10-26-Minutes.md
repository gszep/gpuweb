# ‚è≥ Timeboxes


### [wgsl: decimal point is optional in float literal having an exponent #2201](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2201)



* **Merge**


### [wgsl: detailed semantics of integer division and remainder #1830](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1830)



* MM: I think JS is well-defined there, so we should consider following that.
* JG:
* MM: Two aspects, implementability and consistency.
* JB: JS is IEEE, even for integers, so e.g. x/0=+inf, 0/0=NaN
* MM: WGSL doesn‚Äôt say that NaNs are handled
* JG: What about infinity?
* AB: Also not guaranteed
* MM: It‚Äôs more important that the spec says something, rather than nothing yet.
* JB: I see the spec says we have IEEE, and inf and nan. Is that wrong?
* AB: You can load them, but operations are allowed to assume that there aren‚Äôt inf and nan.
* JB: Can we then just leave it IEEE, and [let the wheels fall off naturally]?
* AB: Do we want to handle 0/0 different from x/0?
* MM: Should probably use the same result for INT_MIN/-1 (overflow) too?
* MM: For the rarer cases, we can probably change it later and people are unlikely to notice.
* **Up to DN for whether to change existing PR**
* **Resolved to try to pick results rather than call it an error.**


### [Support arrayLength for fixed-size arrays #2074](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2074)



* AB: We feel this isn‚Äôt as useful now, and think we should drop it.
* BC: We feel that using a mod-scope-let length i32 as an array length, that‚Äôs what should be done here.
* MM: I do think there‚Äôs value in symmetry here. You say this is a func that operates on the type, but I think we could say it operates on the value anyway, and that authors would be ok with that.
* AB: The runtime array one takes a pointer
* MM: Then we should have two, one that takes a pointer, and one that takes this
* BC: What about side-effects
* MM: If you do arraylength(helperFunc()), I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs very common, as you‚Äôve lost the contents of the array. 
* BC: In the pointer form, I think there can‚Äôt be side-effects.
* MM: Yes
* BC: So I think Google thinks it‚Äôs not important, at least for v1.
* MM: I think it provides weak value at weak cost
* JG: I like allowing the compiler to tell us things that the compiler knows, is good.
* **Defer until after resolution for e.g. dynamic indexing into arrays**

# ‚öñÔ∏è Discussions


### [Literal unification #2200](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2200)



* AB: This came out of discussions internal to Google, but matches some of the feedback that MM gathered also.
* AB: It‚Äôs a layered proposal, such that we can choose how many layers to adopt.
* MM: Proposed something a year and a half ago: [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/739#issuecomment-634874369](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/739#issuecomment-634874369)
* MM: Had 6 goals, this proposal answers most of them
* MM: We would like more precision than this proposal, but like the general direction.
* AB: Sure, wanted to confirm direction before starting to write spec text
* MM: We believe that operators and functions should behave the same way
* MM: Not super sure that what‚Äôs written matches what we have in mind, but I think this is generally the right direction.
* AB: I think up through step 4 matches what you expect.
* Consensus: Don‚Äôt stop between steps 3 and 4
* JG: Do we have consensus for just going through 4?
* MM: I think we might come up with more examples/problem cases once we have something more spec-like.
* BC: So should we just spec 1-4 before speccing step 1?
* **Needs spec, can be spec 1 first, but spec 2-4 together. (or just 1-4 together)**


### [The order of top-level declarations should be irrelevant #875](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/875)



* Previously:
    * BC: Would like to talk to DN about this.
    * DN: Next week is fine, though I‚Äôd like to see a proposal from MM
* BC: DN and I talked. I think having these at the top, or being global would be preferable to having a before-and-after.
* BC: So that‚Äôs Google‚Äôs preference.
* BC: AB also contends that out-of-order declarations should be punted after v1, as it‚Äôs backwards-compatible without it.
* RM: I think my preference is to allow enabling within blocks, and we should say what happens if you e.g. call a function that uses something that‚Äôs not enabled.
* JB: These are subjective, but in Rust, declaration order doesn‚Äôt matter, and I love it.
* JB: Also, ‚Äúextensions‚Äù are so open-ended that it‚Äôs hard for us to be absolutely sure that we will be able to handle anything that might happen.
* MM: Even if you have a function that returns a f16 inside the block, and you call it from outside the block, it‚Äôs the *use* of the type that‚Äôs invalid, even if the author isn‚Äôt writing f16 there.
* AB: GLSL requires at-top decls, and that‚Äôs fine I think. I‚Äôm definitely ok from my C background.
* BC: I also like out-of-order, but I think it‚Äôs fine not to be v1.
* BC: One of the reasons for it is for code-stitching, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a killer feature.
* RM: To clarity, while I have a slight preference for blocks, what I most disliked was before/after, rather than at-top or out-of-order.
* RM: I have a preference for allowing declaring things in any order.
* MM: Worth noting that at-top decl requirement is effectively the same thing as requiring out-of-band.
* RM: Also we have a difference from C/C++: without headers, we cannot declare every function, and then define them in whatever order is most readable/convenient.
* **No consensus yet**


### [MSL does not support address-of vector component #1931](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1931) 



* **(out of time to discuss)**
