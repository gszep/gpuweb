## break if ("too long");

```



*   Remove `break if` remains undecided and will be discussed again at the next meeting.
*   Discussed implicit storage class on variables. Consensus to have an implicit &lt;function> storage class for a `var` inside a function. Discussion around have an implicit &lt;private> for `var` at module scope if not specified. General agreement during the meeting, but counter points raised by Dzmitry on the bug.
*   FAQ discussion was delayed until a future meeting; Goals PR delayed on FAQ discussion.
*   Agreement that implementations would determine the interfaces based on usage in the code. It would _not_ be explicitly specified in the WGSL file.

# **‚öñÔ∏è Discussion**


## **[üîó Issue #643](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/643)** - Remove ``break if`` in favor of ``if() {break; }``



*   RM: Got a question. About comment with snippet of code. Can DN clarify the meaning?
*   DN: So statement A could only possibly execute on the last iteration. It‚Äôs on the way out of the loop. When oyu look at the control flow graph, statement A not in the cycle for the loop. I have memories‚Ä¶
*   RM: From a uniformatic point of view [. . .]
*   DN: That‚Äôs why I said this is a C example, single threaded. Yes, if we apply the uniformity goals then OK, otherwise I‚Äôd like to avoid.
*   John K‚Äôs avatar, referenced in the issue.
*   Overview: Robin and David discuss whether the C example in David‚Äôs comment is actually part of the control flow, or whether it matters from a uniformity point of view.
*   DN: I would like to guide people to patterns with less divergence. [...]. It will be idiomatic that way. 
*   MM: There is no way with `break if` for the A to be in the loop, so, confused.
*   DN: There is complexity added by this. If the code can be outside the loop `break if` forces the code outside the loop
*   RM: Should we have `break if` and `break`
*   DN: would only have `break if` if had to choose, but can have both
*   JG: THis is just about showing the difference between the two. So, a non-trivial compiler could do the work, but in this case the argument is that it‚Äôs valuable to surface that it‚Äôs different
*   MM: How does `break if` solve the statement A issue
*   DN: Difference between C and GPU languages where uniformity kicks in. Having the rule that you have to think about the correctness of where things appear. Want to steer folks away from having to code inside the breaking if condition. There will be ways to express the cond A case, but should be exceptional
*   JG: The Smtt A is about uniformity. Outside the loop it‚Äôs always in uniform control flow, but in the lopo could be non-uniform
*   RM: The uniformity depends on conditional of the loop and the branche
*   MM: So stmt A can‚Äôt be a derivative
*   JG: Correct
*   RM: Sounds like 2 different arguments. Make it difficult to write code with uniformity issues. Write what a simple compiler would do. Do you agree these are 2 concerns
*   DN: Yes. Tried to avoid translator augment. Tend to not mention those arguments but they are additive.
*   RN: Basic blocks would be easy for the compiler to remove. As long as we have the ability to add `break` don‚Äôt see much condition with keeping `break if` for uniformity argument. Do we agree `break if` is semantically equivalent to `if() break` just syntactic sugar
*   DN: Yes, sugar for single threaded code
*   JG: Somewhat worrying that this is opt-in. `break if` can be in best practice document but most people will just use `break` as `break if` is exotic. So we have to handle `if() break` properly
*   DJ: Originally suggested to remove, now talking about leaving it in as optional. Robin suggesting removing as `break` is good enough
*   JG: All just entertaining ideas. Is the extra data for the user of `breka if` useful to the user vs having the compiler handling `if() break`
*   MM: Personally, `do x if y` is harder to understand. Don‚Äôt want to say having an idiomatic way to write clear code is a bad idea.
*   JG: Doesn‚Äôt feel like break if adds that much. Especially if opt-in. On fence of having 2 semantically equivalent things in the language.
*   DN: With `break unless` you have rule that `if condition break` has non-uniform control flow. But not case for `break fi` as uniformity resolves at exit. Having distinct construct means you don‚Äôt have to think much
*   JG: Don‚Äôt agree
*   RN: any case where `if () { A; B; break;}` is different in terms of uniformity?
*   DN: Idea `if () break` without braces
*   DS: Could we force break to be only statement
*   RM: Some cases where you want statements in there, and the break if allows them avoid it so we want to allow it.
*   PJ: This is a new construct so folks won't‚Äô be used to it so a lot of education of shader writers
*   JG: Not that much requirement to do it the right way, would just write `if() {break}` and assume the compiler is doing the right thing.
*   PJ: `break if()` would be unnatural to write
*   DN: We are used to what we‚Äôre used to and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre taught. Turing language is different ordering,
*   PJ: If we allow both most developers will use what they‚Äôre used to
*   KN: No semantic difference between `if (){break;}` and `break if()` so not much high mental overhead of checking what‚Äôs inside that block. Default assumption is that the uniformity is dependent on the if. So, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that different. Extra syntax doesn‚Äôt seem necessary to mark it as non-uniform.
*   JG Give this some thought and work through other issues?
*   MM: Straw poll?
*   JG: Need to think about it
*   DJ: Will come back to it next week.


## **~~[üîó Issue #642](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/642) - Add ``break N`` instead of ``continue`` and ``continuing``~~**


## **[üîó Issue #654](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/654)** - var declaration without storage class: spell out rules, infer Function storage class inside a function



*   DN: Artifact of draft being partial. Canonical way of writing variable is var &lt;storage class > name : type . Because all variables inside a function are function storage class don't‚Äô have to write it. Outside functions default to Private storage class if not provided. Is that a sensible default and should we record it somewhere.
*   JG Sounds reasonable to me
*   MM: Reading about private vs function storage class, understand the words but not how they work together
*   DN: Privat  and function storage class, each work item gets its own copy. The private si for module scoped variables so visible to all functions called from that entry point. The function storage class is scoped to the function in which it is declared. Function storage class at top of function and visible throughout. Lifetime is for the duration of the function call. Same helper function called from 2 places in the call stack would have different Function scoped variables.
*   MM: Like static on a variable in C
*   DN: Yes. Private is static on the module scope. Function storage class is like alloca. If you have a function initializer it is re-initialized every time the function is entered.
*   MM: But for Private they don‚Äôt get re-initialized
*   DN: Right, initialized on top level entry point
*   MM: So, their initializer can‚Äôt depend on state of function
*   DN: Correct in shader can only depend on constants
*   MM: Is there a rule they can only be declared outside functions if they can only depend on constants? \
DN: Yes if you are declared outside a function you _cannot_ be function storage class. Private variables must be declared outside any function. Private storage class can only be outside, Function can only be inside a function.
*   MM: That sounds reasonable.
*   DM: Not a fan of defaulting to Private. Don‚Äôt expect it to be used. Global scope dominated by input/output. Would rather see all the qualifiers at global scope
*   RN: Considering everything inside a function must be function scope, seems like a no-brainer. No opinion on private.
*   DM: Is that true, can we have an input qualifier inside a function? Like a pointer to an input
*   DN: WebGPU Shaders won‚Äôt have pointers, and you can‚Äôt have an input storage class inside a function, must be module scoped. The point of view is reasonable, haven‚Äôt seen that many private variables
*   MM: Just implementing on metal requires some amount of ??? software
*   DN: Would be fine with Dzmitry‚Äôs position, just need a rule
*   MM: Dzmitry.. I don‚Äôt quite understand your argument. Having input/output more common, why should the developer have to type extra stuff
*   DM: Why make an exception for Private when most things will have qualifiers? Will look ore uniform if all things have qualifiers
*   JG: I intuitively assume that anything at global without qualifiers would be private, matches model in my head. This is true in GLSL. In favor of defaulting to private and folks can be explity if they want. Since were already inferring for Function we can infer for Private as well.
*   DM: Different grammar rule.
*   DS: No decorations inside functions for vars.
*   JG: Private is what I‚Äôd expect
*   DM: Private not used often, dominated by input/output and uniforms
*   JG: Asking people to do more work just to do work seems unnecessary
*   MM: Does HLSL have the concept of Private?
*   TR: Not that I‚Äôm trying to understand. Private scope sounds like static but then in a function? \
DN: Private is like a c static variable file scope
*   TR: But not in function? \
DN: Not in function
*   TR: But has a copy?
*   DN: No, for function variables
*   TR: So, just like a module static?
*   DN: Making clarification every invocation gets its own
*   TR: HLSL has htat, static global
*   MM: Is it writable?
*   TR: Yes, jst like C but thread local
*   MM: Are they common?
*   TR: Yup, people use them. Sometimes used to store input values so don‚Äôt have to push down to functions. For translating GLSL for instance since they use globals
*   MM: Makes sense, that maybe the tie breaker.
*   DJ: Leaves consensus leaning towards not requiring Private on Module level variable. Implicitly private unless specified otherwise. Variables in Function are function scoped by default.
*   DM: Still think it‚Äôs an unnecessary complication of the grammar for small benefit. Not a fan of this idea.
*   DJ: Will to accept going against judgement?
*   DM: Yes, it‚Äôs fine.
*   DJ: Resolved.
*   DM: Would like to ask group that all arguments are on the github issue. Folks looking at the discussion will have hard time to determine why the decision was made
*   MM: Do you think linking minutes is not sufficient
*   DM: minutes are the minimum. And they aren‚Äôt necessarily complete. The Rust language process is that all positions are stated on the github issue and the conference call just discusses and does not include new ideas.
*   JG: Think the minutes are generally sufficient.
*   MM: How about arguments are put in the issue afterwards?
*   DS: Could we tldr the notes into the issue?
*   DJ: Resolution is still we came to agreement
*   DN: Trying to summarize high level points
*   DS: Asked for clarification on metal with Private scope
*   MM: Metal doesn‚Äôt have concept, would gather all those global variables and put into struct and entry point declare one instance of that struct and pass a pointer to the struct into each function then reads/writes are done through the struct.


## **[üîó Issue #562](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/562)** - Add FAQ for direction on shader language



*   RM: OK to delay the discussion until next time
*   DJ: Next time
*   RM: Link : [https://github.com/RobinMorisset/gpuweb/tree/wgsl-faq3](https://github.com/RobinMorisset/gpuweb/tree/wgsl-faq3)


## **[üîó Issue #588](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/588)** - Update Goals section of spec



*   DS: Can we merge it or not?
*   MM: I‚Äôd like the discussion on FAQ solved first. We‚Äôve been working hard on the FAQ. Goals should build on them.


## **[üîó Issue #644](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/644)** - Interface matching rules



*   MM: This needs to be in spec. We don‚Äôt have any strong opinion but would like some spec.
*   DM: I think that‚Äôs how rules work for valid use in Vulkan. You can have more things producer than can be consumed, applies to input outputs and render targets too.
*   MM: Is there a logic for not zeroing out things that are consumed by a subsequent stage but not produced.
*   DN: This might require some fix up
*   DJ: So if something gets consumed that‚Äôs not produced that should produce error?
*   JG: Yes
*   DM: May have one vertex shader used with multiple fragment shaders, which would slow down pipeline creation
*   MM: We can start with it being an error
*   DN: Vulkan started with more strict rules but relaxed over time, it settled on something like this a couple of years ago. I am fine with this because it doesn‚Äôt have any performance implications. When assigning locations . Can sweep away variables if they aren‚Äôt used in the interface. Can have interactions with locations if they‚Äôre determined automatically.
*   MM: Shaders can get created as mismatch snippets thrown together. Shader author might not even know what‚Äôs being i/o. Zeroing out could help these situations. But still, I am willing to be OK with the proposal.
*   DS: ...Part in webgpu and part in wgsl. WebGPU should specify that in/out must match between the stages. In WGSL we need to specify that variables used in an entry point must be initialized to zero 
*   DJ: Someone want to write the section?
*   MM: I can.
*   DJ: Assigned to MM
*   DM: So this is the text that will say it formally about being explicit or not about i/o variables
*   MM: Does the driver fix this up?
*   DN: Not sure where requirement comes from, WebGPU spec only requires some things to be initialized
*   DS: That‚Äôs fine, we can make text match requirements.
*   DM: Makes sense for outputs. We don‚Äôt want to completely inspect the control flow and prove it up.
*   JG: WebGL initializes all the outputs at the beginning of the main function.
*   DJ: I think ANGLE also does that. Action on Myles.
